The second is code, the next cell is one containing python code, the code is run on the computer and can have many different effects such as doing math, creating images or displaying text. The code is run by something called an interpreter. The interpreter, translates code, that humnas can read into machine langauge that the computer can understand.\n",

The second line has two different functions, the first is `print()`, which takes the end result of what is within the brackets and displays it, the second is addition. Addition is a math operation that does exactly what you expect it adds numbers, it can also add other things but we will get into that later.

     "Strings and numbers in Python are both what are called objects. In fact everything in Python is an object, `print()` is an object as is `'this object'`, but not all objects are the same they are categorized into different types. String (`str`) is a type of object, meaning they have different attributes than functions (`builtin_function_or_method`) like `print()`. Numbers are actually a few different types, the two you will encounter are integers (`int`) and floating point numbers (`float`). Ints are integers like those from math, they are not fractions and can be negative or positive. Floats are like the real numbers from math, they can be negative or positive and can be any value fraction or whole. Unfortunately floats are not perfectly precise and small rounding errors occur when they are used for math, so they can be tricky to use and generally ints are preferable.\n",

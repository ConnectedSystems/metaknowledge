Entrenchment and the Kripke-Wittgenstein paradox

Author: Dorst, Chris

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1548716365?accountid=14906

Abstract: Surprisingly little attention has been paid to Goodman's own entrenchment-based solution to his New Riddle of Induction. Ostensibly, this is because Goodman views the problem presented by the New Riddle differently than most contemporary philosophers; Goodman sees the problem as one of codifying the acceptable inductive inferences rather than justifying why those inferences are acceptable. I argue that if we share his perspective, Goodman's own solution to the New Riddle is undermined: the linguistic facts about the entrenchment of predicates are no more accessible than facts about which classes are relevant to nature. The result is that Goodman's arguments leave us in a predicament very much like that presented by the Kripke-Wittgenstein paradox about meaning.

The Potential Use of Skin-derived Precursors (SKPs) in Stem-cell Based Therapy for Hirschsprung's Disease

Author: Sun, Xiaoyun

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1691074914?accountid=14906

Abstract: Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is characterized by a reduction or an absence of enteric ganglia in the distal part of the bowel. It is one of the commonest gastrointestinal motility disorders in newborns. Cell replacement has been considered as a potential therapeutic method which provides a renewable source of cells capable of replacing or repairing tissues that have been damaged in some degenerative diseases. Although previous studies have shown that it was possible to use embryonic stem cells to derive neurons and glia after they were transplanted into the recipient guts of mice or rats, a number of problems remain unresolved. The aim of this study was to develop a method to isolate the skin-derived precursors from early postnatal mice, characterize these cells and investigate their therapeutic potential in the mouse model of HSCR. In the first part of the study, the skin-derived precursors were firstly isolated from EGFP mice at postnatal day 1 and cultured as neurospheres. These neurospheres were characterized by multiple immunofluorescence staining, cell proliferation assay and induced differentiation. It was shown that cells from the neurospheres expressed stem cell markers, capable of self-renewal and could be induced to form several types of cells in different differentiation media. The skin-derived cells cultured as neurospheres could be passaged many times in vitro . Their ability of self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation indicated that cells within the neurospheres were stem-liked cells. In the second part of the study, cells of the neurospheres derived the EGFP mouse skin at postnatal day 1 were transplanted to the recipient embryonic hindgut explants which were then maintained in an organotypic culture. The migration and differentiation of engrafted cells from the neurospheres in the recipient hindgut were shown to be influenced not only by the culture medium but also the genotypes of the recipient gut tubes. For instance, the grafted skin-derived precursors could differentiate into neuronal cells in the aganglionic embryonic gut segments isolated from Sox10 Dom/Dom and Sox10 Dom/+ embryos but not in the normal ganglionic hindgut segments from Sox10 +/+ wild type embryos. In the final part, the potential application of skin-derived precursors in vivo was investigated by transplanting them to the descending colon of newborn mice after laparotomy. The immunofluorescence localization showed that the skin-derived precursors colonized the descending colon, and the colonization and differentiation of the engrafted cells in the recipient descending colon were affected by the microenvironment of the colon. In conclusion, the skin-derived precursors isolated from postnatal mouse skin showed the properties of stem cells, including the ability of proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation into different cell types in vitro , and could also give rise to neuronal cells ex vivo in the hindgut segments which were deficient in neural crest cells. In addition, the colonization and differentiation of the engrafted cells in vivo were affected by the microenvironment of the recipient colon.

Hume, Skepticism, and the Search for Foundations

Author: Andrew, James B.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1564772387?accountid=14906

Abstract: In this paper I present an account of how epistemology should be pursued. I challenge epistemological projects which focus exclusively on how our fundamental beliefs about the world--specifically our beliefs about inductive and mathematical knowledge--can be foundationally justified. To their detriment, these projects often ignore the naturalistic question of why we have these beliefs in the first place. Chapter one begins with an account of David Hume's doctrine of knowledge, which is read most often as bifurcating knowledge into two epistemological classes. I refer to this bifurcation as the Received View of Hume's epistemology. On this interpretation, knowledge divides exhaustively into relations of ideas, on the one hand, and matters of fact on the other. Chapter One concludes that attempts to justify either epistemological class unduly overemphasizes the importance of this distinction and risks undermining Hume's actual epistemological goals. I argue that Hume sought a naturalistic explanation of how humans acquire (inductive and mathematical) beliefs as opposed to an explanation that restricts epistemology to a skeptical project of demonstrating why our beliefs are ultimately unjustifiable. Skepticism plays an important role in Hume's epistemology, but this skepticism is less important than his more positive naturalistic project to explain how and why we have different kinds of beliefs. I argue that this latter point has significance beyond interpretive studies of Hume as it has normative implications for the study of knowledge in general: epistemologists should not only establish why our beliefs about the world are justified, but also provide a naturalistic explanation of the etiology of our beliefs. This latter project is often ignored--yet restricting epistemology to the foundational search for justifications cannot succeed on its own, for we can only articulate how our beliefs might be justified by expanding epistemology to include an account of how we acquire our beliefs in the first place. To make this broader point, I focus on movements within the philosophy of science and the philosophy of mathematics which attempt to establish an epistemic foundation to justify our knowledge claims. In Chapter Two, I analyze attempts within the philosophy of science to provide a solution to Hume's problem of induction via some sort of foundational a priori premise or axiom. In Chapter Three, I analyze the logicist and neo-logicist projects within the philosophy of mathematics to provide a foundation for mathematical knowledge--or at least arithmetic--using only basic logical principles. Both of these chapters discuss how these epistemological projects focus exclusively on securing foundations for inductive or mathematical knowledge. Interestingly, both are unsuccessful in achieving their respective justificatory goals. I argue that the ultimate reason for this failure, in both cases, is their exclusive focus on foundations. Thus, in light of these difficulties, Chapter Four concludes by suggesting that epistemology is better served by expanding its project to include a more Humean, naturalistic, and scientific understanding of both inductive and mathematical beliefs in lieu of projects focused exclusively on the epistemic justification of these beliefs. These two projects are "two sides of the same coin," so to speak. If we want to know what justifies our beliefs we have to know how we come to have our beliefs, and vice versa.

Modular Theory and Spacetime Structure in QFT

Author: Swanson, Noel Waldron

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1622398743?accountid=14906

Abstract: In quantum field theory (QFT), physical quantities are represented by a net of operator algebras indexed by spacetime region. Each local algebra comes equipped with a state-dependent pair of modular operators, (J,Δ), encoding vital information about the algebra's internal structure, the local state, and the relational structure of the net. These operators and the associated structure theory are the subject of Tomita-Takesaki modular theory . Despite its importance, the physical significance of modular theory remains murky, and philosophers of QFT have largely ignored it. This dissertation aims to help close the gap. It explores a series of deep connections between modular theory and spacetime geometry established by the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem (which identifies the modular operators attached to spacelike wedge regions in the vacuum sector with certain generators of the Poincaré group). Chapter 1 orients my project within the current philosophical literature on the foundations of QFT. I advocate a cosmopolitan stance towards the subject, incorporating tools from Lagrangian, constructive, and algebraic field theory alike. Adopting this stance, chapter 2 introduces the core mathematical ideas behind modular theory and discusses several important physical applications centered around the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem. Chapter 3 examines how modular theory can be used to give new geometric insight into the parity-charge-time (PCT) theorem. I argue that the key to understanding the mysterious connection between spatiotemporal orientation and charge structure entailed by the theorem lies in recognizing PCT symmetry as a single global reflection of quantum statespace. Chapter 4 turns to the vexed problem of localization in QFT. Modular theory tells us that at a fundamental level the world is thoroughly entangled. In spite of this, via the split/nuclearity conditions, modular theory also supplies critical tools needed to help explain approximately-localized emergent entities like particles and chairs. The final chapter contains a critique of the Connes-Rovelli thermal time hypothesis, a proposal to solve the problem of time in quantum gravity using modular theory. Although I conclude that the current proposal cannot provide a coherent gauge-free description of physical change in generally covariant settings, it does highlight an intriguing connection between modular structure and local dynamics in standard QFT.

Diversity and Cooperation

Author: Bruner, Justin Pearce

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1609717411?accountid=14906

Abstract: The present dissertation is an exploration of the effect of diversity on social contract formation and the evolution of cooperation. This work stems from the pioneering efforts of economist Arthur Robson, who first explored the role of costless pre-game communication in strategic interactions. When communication is permitted, individuals playing a game can condition their behavior on the signal received from their counterpart. For my purposes, I interpret these signals as racial markers or cultural identifiers, which in turn provides a formal framework to precisely study a number of issues relevant to political and social philosophy. My first chapter, "Diversity, Tolerance and the Social Contract", starts by formalizing the state of nature as a game in which individuals can either choose to remain in the state of nature or attempt to found a social contract. I assume there exists some natural diversity in the population, and that individuals are pre-disposed to behave cooperatively with those who are more similar to themselves. I uncover an interesting relationship between diversity, tolerance and the social contract. Social contract formation is possible but initially comes with a cost for both diversity and tolerance. That is to say, individuals quickly all adopt the same signal and only behave cooperatively with those who send similar signals. This, however, is not a long-term feature of the population. In the long run, individuals slowly become more tolerant, cooperating with those who are quite dissimilar to themselves. The circle of cooperation expands, and soon all can partake in a thriving social contract. My second chapter, "Racists and Minorities in Population Games", focuses on the welfare of racial minorities, as well as explores one means of expunging racist attitudes and behaviors from a population. I show that in a wide range of games, minorities are at a distinct disadvantage. Consider the Nash demand game, a canonical bargaining game in which a resource is to be divided between two individuals. I show that in this game, minority status translates into a bargaining disadvantage. In other words, the population tends to settle on an equilibrium in which individuals from theracial majority receive the bulk of the resource. Interestingly, this minority disadvantage is not due to differential abilities or effort, but is instead simply in virtue of the minority's relative size. Second, I consider one means of reducing racist behavior. If individuals are allowed to send a plastic signal that is independent of their fixed racial signal, then individuals tend to condition their behavior on the plastic signal of their counterpart, which in turn facilitates high levels of cooperation. My final chapter, "The Possibility of Pluralism", explores cooperation and diversity in the context of a liberal pluralistic society. In such a society, many different valid conceptions of the good would exist, and individuals would ideally be tolerant of different moral beliefs and practices. Yet under what conditions is such an arrangement possible? Taking my cue from the political philosopher Gregory Kavka, I investigate how disagreement among individuals with different value systems would be settled. Individuals can either compromise and find some middle ground, or dig their heels in and refuse to concede. Using computer simulations, I identify that conflict is minimized when, among other things, individuals are embedded on a social network and are allowed to employ somewhat sophisticated strategies, such as tit-for-tat.

The Rise of the Small: Meaning, Metaphysics, and the Microscope

Author: Mikos, Keith Michael

Abstract: From public reminders to sanitize drinking water to philosophical speculation on the sublime, this study documents how microscopical science appears in a wide range of cultural and intellectual concerns. Interweaving a genealogy of microscopy with readings of literary texts, I show how the microscope embodies certain epistemological formulations that disclose original literary and philosophical networks. Through readings of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Charles Sanders Peirce, Herman Melville, and Emily Dickinson, along with diverse intertexts from philosophy, science, and literature, I expose the influence that microscopy had on nineteenth century American metaphysics, spirituality, fiction, and figuration. It explores, for example, questions of invisibility and faith in early American writers such as John Winthrop, Jr. and Cotton Mather, who believed that the microscope presented a divinely mandated opportunity to fully comprehend God's universe, and follows through with Emerson's later arguments that the instrument endorses a dangerous mechanistic ideology at odds with his spiritual sensibilities. It explains how Peirce viewed the microscope as a means through which to rescue philosophy from crude and untenable metaphysics, how Melville embraced the microscopical to enact a theory of symbolism, how Dickinson meditated on the spiritual dangers of "looking too closely," and how writers from numerous disciplines have all struggled to make sense of extended human vision. The study closes by discussing the model of "deep time" literary history, and questioning the status of the aesthetic detail when placed on the vast scale of a universe expanded by optical instruments. This cosmic vastness threatens to annihilate the significance of human intellectual pursuits, leading to a "scaling-up" that I argue is best addressed in existentialist terms. The microscope made available a novel means of imagining the infinite while revealing the limits of natural perception, expanding assumed scales of understanding, and challenging inherently prejudiced biological categories and social stratifications. This work demonstrates how the microscope came to be, the polemics it provoked, the ideas it preserves, and the role it played in the formations of nineteenth century philosophy, science, fiction, and poetry.

Wallace's Line: Alfred Russel Wallace, biogeography, environment and scientific advancement

Author: Matykiewicz, E. S.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1560291450?accountid=14906

Abstract: Alfred Russel Wallace, whose independent discovery of natural selection prompted Charles Darwin to publish his magnum opus, On the Origin of Species, is perhaps better remembered for his contributions to biogeography than evolutionary theory. His namesake, the Wallace Line, delineates an abrupt and curious intangible boundary that separates Australian fauna from Asian Fauna. While one continent's fauna are often highly distinct from the other continent's fauna, their distinctiveness is relative to the vast oceanic or latitudinal separation. In contrast, Asia and Australia are connected by a string of contiguous islands that could presumably allow for a gradient of species dispersal. Counterintuitive to the understanding of naturalists in the 19 th century and beyond, the patterns of flora and fauna on the adjacent islands in the Australasian Archipelago are so remarkably different that the area cannot be treated as one single biogeographic region, nor can it be seen as a transition state. Wallace observed this, and attempted to sketch the line that marked the distinct separation. This line created a controversial outflow of opinions, well into the twentieth century, based on the exact delineation of the faunal barrier. Research concerning the biogeographic region's internal and external boundaries continues in a diversity of fields and subfields. Wallace's namesake and publications on the Malay Archipelago, its natural productions, biogeography, and conceptions of the natural world drew envy, ire, admiration and respect. His synthesis and integration of fields created an empire of science based on one region, due to that region's tropical diversity, that propelled science forward immensely, for better or worse, and deserves recognition for his immense contributions to the pursuit of scientific knowledge- an intellectual Wallace Line.

Speculative Physics: the Ontology of Theory and Experiment in High Energy Particle Physics and Science Fiction

Author: Lee, Clarissa Ai Ling

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1611964028?accountid=14906

Abstract: The dissertation brings together approaches across the fields of physics, critical theory, literary studies, philosophy of physics, sociology of science, and history of science to synthesize a hybrid approach for instigating more rigorous and intense cross-disciplinary interrogations between the sciences and the humanities. I explore the concept of speculation in particle physics and science fiction to examine emergent critical approaches for working in the two areas of literature and physics (the latter through critical science studies), but with the expectation of contributing new insights to media theory, critical code studies, and also the science studies of science fiction. There are two levels of conversations going on in the dissertation; at the first level, the discussion is centered on a critical historiography and philosophical implications of the discovery Higgs boson in relation to its position at the intersection of old (current) and the potential for new possibilities in quantum physics; I then position my findings on the Higgs boson in connection to the double-slit experiment that represents foundational inquiries into quantum physics, to demonstrate the bridge between fundamental physics and high energy particle physics. The conceptualization of the variants of the double-slit experiment informs the aforementioned critical comparisons. At the second level of the conversation, theories are produced from a close study of the physics objects as speculative engine for new knowledge generation that are then reconceptualized and re-articulated for extrapolation into the speculative ontology of hard science fiction, particularly the hard science fiction written with the double intent of speaking to the science while producing imaginative and socially conscious science through the literary affordances of science fiction. The works of science fiction examined here demonstrate the tension between the internal values of physics in the practice of theory and experiment and questions on ethics, culture, and morality. Nevertheless, the dissertation hopes to show the beginnings of a possibility, through the contentious but generative space provided by speculative physics, to produce more cross-collaborative thinking between physics as represented by the hard sciences, and science fiction representing the objects of literary enterprise and creative evolution.

Apparatus poetica: The question of technology in mid-twentieth-century American poetry

Author: Slater, Avery

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1634332256?accountid=14906

Abstract: "Apparatus Poetica" considers how four poets in the late modernist tradition reconceive the potentials of poetic language in order to address the question of advanced technology. Outlining challenges posed to language by communications industries, information theory, computation, and the threat of nuclear war, I show how four poets--James Merrill, Muriel Rukeyser, H.D., and Jack Spicer--explore affinities and crucial distinctions between poetry and technology. Through their experiments in what I call "apparatus poetics," these poets denaturalize culturally embedded assumptions surrounding technology's "neutrality" and poetry's expressive "purity." They do so through procedural innovations in the genre of the poetic epic, that form not coincidentally deemed by modernist anthropologists as the earliest human memory-technology. I begin with a discussion of how the montage apparatus of testimonial poetry in Rukeyser's The Book of the Dead works to indict industrial capital's technological tactics of historical effacement. I next discuss how Jack Spicer, working as a structural linguist in the age of IBM, uses a late modernist method, the "serial lyric," to set up a confrontation between poetic consciousness and language. Spicer casts the old predicament of thought's alienation from language in a new light defined by contemporary forms of technological emergence (especially computational intelligence). In the historical moment where databases begin to supplant cultural archives, H.D.'s Helen in Egypt meditates on translation and disintegration at the virtual horizon of memory and myth. I attend to how H.D.'s late-career epic revives an earlier, modernist moment of inquiry into the "machine mind" and "mnemic technology" through her collaboration with Sigmund Freud. I conclude with an exploration of how James Merrill's The Changing Light at Sandover engages language's aleatory powers to situate inspiration's accidents amid uncertain historical and technological horizons. This dissertation explores how these late modernists use language's techne to rethink mid-century historical forces catalyzed by technology. Insisting on language's poetic ability to exceed instrumentalized capture, these poets share an interest in theorizing new ethical relations for reconnecting "subject" and "process" in an age when forms of collectivity are undergoing rapid technological redefinition.

Psychotherapy and the Embodiment of the Neuronal Identity: A Hermeneutic Study of Louis Cozolino's (2010) "The Neuroscience of Psychotherapy: Healing the Social Brain"

Author: Natinsky, Ari

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1650710523?accountid=14906

Abstract: In recent years, there have been several ways in which researchers have attempted to integrate psychotherapy and neuroscience research. Neuroscience has been proposed as a method of addressing lingering questions about how best to integrate psychotherapy theories and explain their efficacy. For example, some psychotherapy outcome studies have included neuroimaging of participants in order to propose neurobiological bases of effective psychological interventions (e.g., Paquette et al., 2003). Other theorists have used cognitive neuroscience research to suggest neurobiological correlates of various psychotherapy theories and concepts (e.g., Schore, 2012). These efforts seem to embody broader historical trends, including the hope that neuroscience can resolve philosophical questions about the relationship between mind and body, as well as the popular appeal of contemporary brain research. In this hermeneutic dissertation I examined a popular neuropsychotherapy text in order to explore the historical fit between neuroscience and psychotherapy. The study identifies the possible understandings of the self (i.e., what it means to be human) that could arise from Western therapy discourses that are based on neuroscientific interpretations of psychotherapy theories. The methodology of this dissertation consisted of a critical textual analysis of Louis Cozolino's (2010) The Neuroscience of Psychotherapy: Healing the Social Brain. The primary content, rhetorical strategies, and recurring themes in Cozolino's book were outlined and interpreted from a hermeneutic perspective. This included a historical critique of Cozolino's claims about the origins, purpose, and efficacy of psychotherapy, his assertions about the relationship between self and brain, and examples of his psychotherapy case vignettes. Rhetorical strategies in his writing included analogy, ambiguity, speculative language, and figures of speech such as metaphor and personification. A discussion of these findings addressed the implications of Cozolino's efforts with regards to patient care, psychotherapy theory integration, and the possible effects that these efforts may have on the profession of psychology. The electronic version of this dissertation is at OhioLink ETD Center, www.ohiolink.edu/etd.

Abstract: Symbols connect our deepest thoughts with our senses. This thesis explores the Alchemical symbols, developed by mythical deity Hermes Trismegistus, whose symbols remnant of geometric shapes represent the classical elements of Earth, Water, Fire and Air. Watercolor, graphite, and gesso are my primary materials as they can be manipulated by the classical element of water. With this, I can create representations of the symbols through the language of drawing. The audience is invited to open their thoughts and all senses to the Alchemical symbols and the distinctive forms that appear from the visual mixture of the materials.

More than nothing: Histories of the vacuum in theoretical physics, 1927-1981

Author: Wright, Aaron Sidney

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1699060621?accountid=14906

Abstract: This dissertation is an historical ontology of the vacuum in theoretical physics from Dirac to Zeldovich. It traces changing views of the ontology of the vacuum though communities of both quantum theorists and general "relativists." Rather than a traditional micro study of one actor, or a small group of connected actors, it is a "meso" history, following the idea of the vacuum across approximately 55 years and from the United States to the Soviet Union. This meso-scale analysis allows me to mediate between the individual concerns of historical actors at the chapter-level and a broader historical-philosophical question at the dissertation-level: how can we be realists about unobservable theoretical entities like the vacuum in the light of changing ontologies? However, too fine a distinction must not be drawn between ontologies and epistemologies here. An overall theme of the dissertation is the connection between the tools theorists used and their ontological pictures. Chapters cover P.A.M. Dirac; Julian Schwinger and Richard Feynman; John Archibald Wheeler; Roger Penrose; Sidney Coleman; and Vladimir Fock and Yakov Zeldovich. All chapters are based on archival research except the final body-chapter on Fock and Zeldovich, which is based on materials in translation. I make a positive case for the claim that one can be a realist about theoretical entities like the vacuum only when considered from a Deluezian, differential perspective. Difference is put forth as a creative engine for science.

The role of values in theory choice: Debating biological race

Author: Givhan, Anthony E.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1496772860?accountid=14906

Abstract: Can so-called non-cognitive values be used legitimately in good science? I argue that they have a legitimate role in several areas of science, namely the context of discovery, the context of investigation, and the context of application, but that they do not have a legitimate role in the area of scientific theory assessment. In this area they ought to be avoided because their use in this area makes for bad science. I then use the debate about whether or not race is a biological concept as an application and case study to illustrate the use of the values which ought to be used for assessing theories, cognitive values. I conclude that biological race is not real and we can make this judgment without using non-cognitive values. In the introduction I clarify various issues involved in the values debate. I then explain why I believe that the disagreement regarding whether or not race is biologically real makes for a helpful case study when considering the role of values in science. I show that the disagreement is often seen as being motivated by various non-cognitive values; that is to say, each side claims the other is being inappropriately influenced by non-cognitive values. In Chapter 1 I lay out the various arguments for and against whether ancient civilizations held to the concept of race and show that there are problems with both sides of the issue and thus, neither side can say that the fact that the ancients believe one way or the other helps their case, as is often claimed. In Chapter 2 I critically examine some of the major theories of race and suggest that they do not work. I conclude that while we can find all kinds of differences between groups these differences do not seem to allow us to make any meaningful biological distinctions. I then raise the question again whether or not non-cognitive values have influenced the race debate. In Chapter 3 I work through an account of how non-cognitive values function in various areas of science and argue that in good science non-cognitive values ought to be avoided in the context of assessment. Chapter 4 lays out an account of why cognitive, what I call epistemic and non-epistemic values, are to be used to assess theory choice. I argue that other so-called non-cognitive values for instance, ideological, psychological, ethical values, etc., ought not to be used. I argue that only those values that aid in justifying or directly assessing beliefs as true (epistemic values) or those that aid in our understanding and explanation (non-epistemic cognitive values) ought to be used to judge a theory as good, and non-cognitive values do not do this. Finally, I suggest that the lack of consensus on the biological reality of race may be due to different approaches motivated by different research programs and not necessarily the inappropriate influence of non-cognitive values. Chapter 5 attempts to apply the notion of the appropriate use of values in scientific assessment. I make a distinction between the question, "What is a biological race?" and the question, "Do biological races exist?" I maintain that these are two different questions and result in different metaphysical assumptions about the existence of race, and thus lead to different research programs. I pose two problems facing those in research programs that assume and posit the reality of biological race, a classification problem, which seems to cause the notion of race to fail what I call the non-epistemic cognitive values test, and a sorting problem, which seems to cause the notion of race to fail what I call the epistemic values test. I maintain that as a result of these problems race is not biologically real.

Quantify this: Statistics, the state, and governmentality

Author: Fried, Samantha J.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1531331468?accountid=14906

Abstract: This thesis seeks to examine the following question: what is the relationship between national statistics and governmental control? To explore this question, it will examine three historical case studies, all taking place in Western Europe in the 18th and 19th Centuries. These historical case studies will focus on the beginnings of censuses in Great Britain, Germany and France. They exhibit that the relationship between national statistics and state control is complex and non-linear, and that the absence of statistics is also a means through which very strong governmental power can be asserted. Overall, this paper advocates for a greater societal awareness of the complicated implications of national statistics.

The Theory, Practice, and Future of Ethics Education in Science

Author: Milleson, Valerye

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1571318326?accountid=14906

Abstract: The landscape of science education is changing. Scientific research and the academy are both becoming increasingly complex, competitive, interdisciplinary, and international. Many federal research agencies, scientific professional societies, and science educators seem to agree on the importance of strong ethics education to help young scientists navigate this increasingly craggy terrain. But, what actually should be done? When it comes to teaching ethics to future scientists, is the apparent current emphasis on basic responsible conduct of research (RCR) sufficient, or should moral theory also be taught in science ethics education? In this thesis I try engage this question by focusing on an existing, related debate on whether moral theory should be part of teaching professional ethics more generally. After delving into the respective approaches promoted by the three primary participants in this debate (C. E. Harris, Bernard Gert, and Michael Davis) I unpack their views in order to ascertain their practical application potential and relative benefits. I then take these findings and apply them to ethics education in science, paying particular attention to its purported learning objectives. In the end I conclude that the presentation of these objectives suggests that moral theory may well be required in order for these objectives of ethics education in science to be fully achieved.

Toward an Analytic Sociology: Reconciling Structural and Individualistic Explanations of Social Phenomena via a Theory of Embodied Practice

Author: Polyakov, Michael

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1665573487?accountid=14906

Abstract: Social theory explanations commonly take one of two forms. Accounts couched in terms of macroscopic entities such as institutions, culture, class, structure and tradition tend to privilege stability and regularity. Individualistic explanations, on the other hand, take these entities to be ultimately reducible to free actions of individuals and are most adept at explaining transformation and volatility in the social realm. These two forms of explanation are rooted in radically different ontological and normative assumptions, and no attempt to connect them has garnered wide acceptance to date. This dissertation once re-examines the tension between them, which has become known as the "structure vs. agency" debate, by drawing on and extending the insights of "theories of practice", a literature that locates the junction of structure and agency in the routines of ordinary daily activities. The dissertation begins by critically examining two extant theories of practice. One originates in Pierre Bourdieu, Anthony Giddens, and William Sewell's responses to structuralism; the other is articulated by Theodore Schatzki, who draws on Ludwig Wittgenstein to characterize practice as a semantic lens through which social actors make sense of the world. An alternative theory of practice is then developed, inspired by Charles Taylor's Heideggerian conception of embodied agency. This theory of "embodied practice" advances a novel formulation of the structure-agent relationship. Through a fine-grained analysis of the cognitive and informational processes by which practices project a semantic dimension onto the world, embodied practice theory renders robust forms of personal agency compatible with certain forms of semantic macrostructures. The dissertation goes on to describe how embodied practices can account for both change and stability in society and how the concept of an embodied practice may be profitably employed in applied social analysis and political theory.

Abstract: Historians of science regard John Herschel (1792.1871) as one of the most influential British natural philosophers of the nineteenth century. He made important contributions in chemistry, optics, and the philosophy of science, but he was most widely regarded for his astronomical work. His investigations and publications on double stars, nebulae, variable stars, and constellation reform extended throughout his career and form an important chapter in sidereal astronomy prior to the advent of astrophysics. This dissertation is the first extensive survey of Herschel's stellar astronomy, drawing upon his correspondence and unpublished diaries and manuscripts in addition to his scientific papers and texts. After a survey of historical ideas regarding the physical nature of the stars, the study examines Herschel's relationship with nineteenth-century positional astronomy and argues that Herschel viewed star catalogues as a means of obtaining information on the physical nature of stars. By exploring Herschel's contributions in double star and variable star research, this study illustrates how Herschel brought these fields of inquiry from the astronomical periphery, making them subjects of physico-mathematical research endeavors pursued by multiple observers. The work next contextualizes Herschel's prismatic analysis, situating Herschel's spectral investigations within his optical and photographical researches and offering an explanation of his ultimate response to spectroscopy. Finally, it concludes with a survey of Herschel's influence on science writers throughout the nineteenth century to illustrate how his stellar conceptions were accepted and disseminated more broadly. This treatment of Herschel's stellar astronomy addresses broader questions in the history of nineteenth--]century science. Firstly, it shows the evolution of conceptions regarding the stars in the decades leading up to spectroscopy. Drawing on assumptions common since the time of Copernicus, Herschel was instrumental in establishing and communicating many newly measured stellar properties. Secondly, this investigation complicates the division between amateur and professional astronomers during this period as Herschel attempted to recruit members of both observing communities for his projects. Herschel's work marks the transition of sidereal astronomy from being the sole property of those with large telescopes as he advocated for programs in which even naked eye observers could make important contributions to understanding the stars.

A philosophical analysis of the mechanisms of natural thinking and artificial intelligence

Author: Aberek, Boris

Abstract: In this thesis we focus mainly on the field of philosophy of the mind and learning, one of its particularly important elements, where from the early beginning of thinking about a human as a thinking "machine" to the contemporary teaching about this problem, we continuously observe two ways of explaining: A mysterian one, which posits that the mind is something unique and is a source of some mysteries which are characteristic only of studies of the mind. Consequently, we could conclude that the mind is completely different from anything else in the world and must therefore have a special ontological position. A naturalistic one, which posits that the mind can, or even must be, "naturalised", so that mental conditions and processes are describable with the language of science: physics, cognitive science or languages of other natural sciences. According to this approach we expect that a human being is a part of nature, and the processes which happen in he human being, including mental processes, are also a part of nature. Both approaches try to find the truth, but both of them use totally different methods and tools and interpret findings from totally different theoretical backgrounds and origins. In this thesis, we advocate a naturalistic approach, based on current natural sciences, their methods, and reductionism in the theory of the mind with an emphasis on engine learning as a paradigmatic case of an algorithmically reducible mental process with the possibility of application on human beings. In this case, when the machine is learning, we can reduce this learning to algorithms or physical processes. In addition, mental processes in human can be reduced and written as dynamic models. Such reductionist approaches in the frame of philosophy, cognitive science neurobiology, neuro-computer science and artificial intelligence often pose the question of what connection there is, if any, between the development of cognitive science and neuro-computer science. So far, no final answer has been found to three key questions in this field: Can we entirely (neuro)model and simulate brain functioning with the help of current computer technologies? Can the development of neuro-computer science and artificial intelligence lead to the replacement of human beings and their natural intelligence ( directly - a humanoid robot, engine or machine which does humans' jobs; or indirectly - a computer "teacher", an intelligent tutor, which performs only humans' mental functions). Can a human - his metal life --be reduced via mathematical algorithms to brain processes? For example, is there such a system of differential equations by which the mind could be written and which could be used to bridge a gap between two different sciences, i.e. psychology as a special science and physics as a basic science. This thesis will answer these questions. The thesis is designed along the historical principle, where from the early beginnings of philosophical thinking about the mind we continue through the past and present to the near and distant future of the idea of artificial human beings and argue for a naturalistic approach, based on current natural sciences and their methods, and reductionism in the theory of the mind with an emphasis on the possibilities of algorithmic reduction of mental processes in human beings on dynamic models.

Psyche=singularity: A comparison of Carl Jung's transpersonal psychology and Leonard Susskind's holographic string theory

Author: Desmond, Timothy

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1540841288?accountid=14906

Abstract: In this dissertation I discern what Carl Jung calls the mandala image of the ultimate archetype of unity underlying and structuring cosmos and psyche by pointing out parallels between his transpersonal psychology and Stanford physicist Leonard Susskind's string theory. Despite his atheistic, materialistically reductionist interpretation of it, I demonstrate how Susskind's string theory of holographic information conservation at the event horizons of black holes, and the cosmic horizon of the universe, corroborates the following four topics about which Jung wrote: (1) his near-death experience of the cosmic horizon after a heart attack in 1944; ( 2) his equation relating psychic energy to mass, "Psyche=highest intensity in the smallest space" (1997, 162), which I translate into the equation, Psyche=Singularity; (3) his theory that the mandala, a circle or sphere with a central point, is the symbolic image of the ultimate archetype of unity through the union of opposites, which structures both cosmos and psyche, and which rises spontaneously from the collective unconscious to compensate a conscious mind torn by irreconcilable demands (1989, 334-335, 396-397); and (4) his theory of synchronicity. I argue that Susskind's inside-out black hole model of our Big Bang universe forms a geometrically perfect mandala: a central Singularity encompassed by a two-dimensional sphere which serves as a universal memory bank. Moreover, in precise fulfillment of Jung's theory, Susskind used that mandala to reconcile the notoriously incommensurable paradigms of general relativity and quantum mechanics, providing in the process a mathematically plausible explanation for Jung's near-death experience of his past, present, and future life simultaneously at the cosmic horizon. Finally, Susskind's theory also provides a plausible cosmological model to explain Jung's theory of synchronicity--meaningful coincidences may be tied together by strings at the cosmic horizon, from which they radiate inward as the holographic "movie" of our three-dimensional world.

Effecting Science in Affective Places: The Rhetoric of Science in American Science and Technology Centers

Author: Herman, Jennifer Linda

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1647478711?accountid=14906

Abstract: My dissertation traces and analyzes the identifications with science that emerge in the rhetorical tradition of the multimodal exhibition of scientific objects, concepts, processes, and practices in the museum context. I demonstrate how multimodal exhibits in science centers have embedded implicit instruction in scientific method and its value; these identifications with science are further reinforced and complicated by wider cultural expectations and ambitions for science and science centers, and how those expectations and ambitions come to be realized in the built spaces of the science centers enclosing the exhibits themselves. I argue that the display of science exhibits within the context of science centers' built spaces reproduces a rhetorical tradition that encourages visitors to respond according to sense-making conventions that are historic in origins, and which privilege a "folk epistemology of common sense empiricism." The compelling characterization of science as a process conducted through careful observation and inference was separated from the dominant definition of science when experimental science displaced analytical science and its practice moved from private homes and museums to university laboratories. In the twentieth century, through their reproduction of exhibits' "naked eye science," museums--both natural history and the emerging institution of the science center--preserved the now-outdated theory of knowledge-making with objects. As cultural expectations and ideas about science changed during the twentieth century, the needs of local communities hosting science centers changed, and science center institutions and buildings were adapted to address new educational, economic and civic demands. While exhibits' sense-making functions remained based on the assumption that science is done through careful observation of past events, new architectures and built spaces enclosing those exhibits realized celebratory functions for their surrounding communities, conferring on the exhibits the community's value for science as a vehicle of economic and social progress, an exciting exploration of received facts, and a process to be mastered by the "noble scientist." My study reveals not only varying levels of complexity by which communicative modes function together to realize scientific meanings, but also how the convergence of historic, social, and material factors influence the meanings that exhibits and their exhibit designers may make available to visitors. Additionally, because some research suggests that the primary effect of the museum experience is not better understanding of science, but a new excitement or curiosity about it, understanding the affective aspects of identification in science centers can help scholars better understand how attitudes towards science are shaped in specific contexts. The celebratory identifications with science are the most prominent aspect of the museum experience, and as a result, these science centers promote an outdated conception of science that is exciting, but sets up its audience--American children and families, primarily--for unexpected disappointment and frustration when they encounter the true intellectual challenges and laborious repetition of scientific practice. Further, those celebratory functions may be politicized and co-opted by other institutions with motives that run directly counter to those of the science center.

Bio-Enhanced Constructivism: Moral Facts for the Naturalistic but Morally Serious Philosopher

Author: Gardner, Jason

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1650591989?accountid=14906

Abstract: There is a tension between being both morally and naturalistically serious because it is doubtful that features philosophers have ascribed to moral facts in order to explain why we should take them seriously can be given a naturalistic accounting. Yet even serious naturalists who think the tension is real and troubling persist in trying to be serious moralists. I do not think they can do so on their own terms. Thus the purpose of this dissertation: to inquire after a perfectly natural way to think about morality, one that begins by examining the colloquially moral behaviors of the natural human animal, one that also demands that we take morality seriously. I call the view that emerges 'Bio-Enhanced Constructivism'. It consists of two theses: the Human Nature Thesis saying it belongs to the human species to have peculiarly moral desires, and the Biological Construction Claim saying moral facts are determined by certain evaluations that these desires dispose us to make. I defend the view in three steps. First I present evidence from the biological and psychological sciences for the Human Nature Thesis. Then I argue that the Biological Construction Claim is the only viable way to make sense of how there could moral facts determined by our evaluations. Finally, I consider a great number of objections claiming to undermine the justification a bio-enhanced constructivist offers for our taking morality seriously and I show that none of these objections is able to uphold its claim.

No Metaphysics within Physics?

Author: Miller, Elizabeth

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1557753775?accountid=14906

Abstract: This dissertation has three parts. In "Quantum Entanglement, Bohmian Mechanics, and Humean Supervenience," I defend David Lewis's metaphysical doctrine of Humean supervenience, and traditional metaphysical reductionism more generally, against an alleged holistic threat encapsulated in the non-separability argument from quantum entanglement. I argue that, contrary to popular belief, realism about quantum mechanics is compatible with Humean reductionism. In "Humean Scientific Explanation," I consider a different sort of charge, aimed at Humean accounts of laws of nature in particular, which says that Humean laws cannot underwrite satisfactory scientific explanations. I distinguish three Humean answers to this allegation that, interestingly, correspond to three ways of thinking about relations of grounding, or metaphysical explanation, linking Humean laws and their instances, all of which are consistent with the doctrine of Humean supervenience. In "Two Notions of Holism," I suggest that metaphysical reductionists and holists alike can, and should, recognize the holistic predictive structure of quantum theory. Committed metaphysical holists then may motivate their metaphysical position as offering an explanation for the predictive holism found in quantum theory. In pursuing this strategy, however, metaphysical holists may draw on explanatory assumptions that their reductive opponents need not accept.

Ectopic fat and adipose tissue inflammation in overweight and obese African Americans and Hispanics

Author: Alderete, Tanya Lynn

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1629829109?accountid=14906

Abstract: Studies have shown that obesity is linked to insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes, yet the exact mechanism(s) linking excess adiposity to increased disease risk is unknown. Studies suggest that visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and liver fat (LF) contribute to the development of IR and risk for T2D. However, this theory is challenged by the fact that overweight and obese African Americans (AAs) have less VAT and LF than Hispanics, yet share a similar risk for IR and T2D. Recent data suggest that excess adipose tissue contributes to chronic inflammation, thereby promoting the development of IR and other metabolic complications. Supporting this idea, recent studies have found that anti-inflammatory drugs, such as salsalate, decrease markers of inflammation and improve glucose control in Caucasian adults with T2D and/or impaired glucose control. Overall, the purpose of this dissertation was multi-faceted where we focused on both the location and inflammatory state of adipose tissue. In order to examine adipose tissue inflammation, we developed a novel biopsy method to sample large quantities of intact subcutaneous adipose tissue for a variety of research purposes (e.g., cell sorting, histology, gene expression). This allowed us to perform a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in obese Hispanic young adults in order to determine whether any salsalate-induced metabolic improvements were mediated by changes in adipose tissue inflammation. From these studies, we show that high LF was more strongly associated with decreased insulin sensitivity and β-cell function among African Americans (AAs) compared to Hispanics. Our results suggest that Hispanics exhibited appropriate β-cell compensation for liver fat induced insulin resistance where AAs did not. These findings may partially explain why AAs are a great risker for T2D, despite having lower levels of LF and VAT when compared to Hispanics. Our work focusing on adipose tissue inflammation led us to develop a novel biopsy method where we were able to sample large quantities of intact adipose tissue (~1.5 g). This method allowed us to systematically examine the effects of salsalate on various markers of adipose tissue inflammation. Overall, we confirmed that salsalate improved metabolic outcomes related to T2D risk in otherwise healthy obese Hispanics. Our finding suggests that these improvements occurred in the absence of any significant alterations to adipose tissue inflammation. Taken together, our results suggest that although specific patters of fat distribution and inflammation contribute to T2D risk, salsalate does not target adipose tissue inflammation. Future studies should examine other treatment strategies and/or therapeutic targets in an effort to decrease obesity-associated inflammation as a means to decrease disease risk.

A New Foundation for the Disciplines of Philosophy and Psychology: Unification without Consilience

Author: Mun, Cecilea

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1640934290?accountid=14906

Abstract: Do emotions help explain our behaviors? Can they condemn us, excuse us, orr mitigate our moral responsibility orr blameworthiness? Can they explain our rationality and irrationality, orr warrant such attributions? Can they be justified orr warranted? Are they constitutive aspects of our consciousness, identity, characters, virtues, orr epistemic status? The answer to these questions, at least to a significant extent, depends on what emotions are. This illustrates the importance of what emotions are to academics across multiple disciplines, as well as to members of governing bodies, organizations, communities, and groups. Given the great importance of emotions to various aspects of our lives, this dissertation is about the relevance of the topic of emotion as an area of study for the discipline of philosophy. This dissertation is also broadly about the need to bridge the interests, concerns, and collective bodies of knowledge between various distinct disciplines, thereby contributing to the process of unifying knowledge across the various disciplines within the realm of academia. The primary aim in this dissertation is to initiate the unification of the interests, concerns, and collective bodies of knowledge across disciplines of academia. To do so, however, this dissertation aims to bridge some disciplinary divides between the disciplines of philosophy and psychology. I fulfill this aim by first demonstrating that interdisciplinary research and theorizing is needed within the disciplines of philosophy and psychology. I do this by considering how the problem of skepticism arises within these two disciplines. I also derive, propose, and argue for the acceptance of a new foundation for academic research and theorizing in response to the problem of skepticism. I refer to my proposal, in general, as The Proposal for Unification without Consilience (UC).

Structures and objects: A defense of structural realism

Author: Glick, David A.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1559962086?accountid=14906

Abstract: What stance should we take toward our best scientific theories? Traditionally, there have been two answers: realism and antirealism. Structural realism is an attempt to find middle-ground between these two views. Rather than accept everything our best theories seem to say about the world, the structural realist endorses only what those theories tell us about the structure of the world. I argue that switching the focus to structure allows the realist to better deal with problems of theory-change, and to better make sense of contemporary physics. I go on to offer a specific version of structural realism based on an understanding of structures as networks of relations between objects that are nothing more than places in structures. My view allows that there are objects and relations, but reverses the usual order of dependence: objects depend on relations rather than the other way around.

Causation in a physical world

Author: Blanchard, Thomas

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1654751921?accountid=14906

Abstract: This dissertation offers a new solution to the problem of causation in the physical world. Fundamental physics leaves little space for causation. Causation is local and asymmetric, but physical laws are global and time-symmetric. However, causal notions are indispensable. In particular we need causation to make sense of effective strategies. The problem of causation in the physical world is the challenge of reconciling the a-causal physical picture of the world with the need for causation. Chapter 1 describes the problem in detail and proposes a new methodology to solve it. The proper method to handle the problem isn't conceptual analysis. Rather, solutions to the problem should be judged on how well they physically explain actual facts about effective strategies. Chapter 2 examines the main attempts to solve the problem. I argue that they all face various problems. In particular, current attempts to locate causation in the physical world all have trouble making sense of the fact that we need causal knowledge to make rational decisions. To solve this problem, the first step is to provide a satisfactory explanation of why only those correlations that are (intuitively) causal can be exploited for the purpose of securing desired outcomes. In chapter 3, I propose such an explanation. I argue that causal correlations are the only ones that can be exploited according to evidential decision theory (EDT). This is a surprising claim, since EDT is widely thought to recommend acting for the sake of outcomes one cannot cause. I arguethat this is actually not the case, and that EDT in fact provides a plausible account of exploitable correlations. In chapter 4, I use this account to offer a new solution to the problem of causation in a physical world. I argue that causal dependence is a matter of the cause and the effect standing in certain probabilistic relations to a third event called a probabilistic intervention. Probabilistic interventions are events that need not involve agency but nonetheless mimic certain crucial features of deliberation. I argue that this account provides a plausible solution to the problem of causation in a physical world.

The Salmon-Roe Approach to Mechanistic Explanations

Author: Roe, Sarah Marie

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1628981675?accountid=14906

Abstract: For the past three decades, the concept of 'mechanism' has regained centrality in science as well as philosophy of science. Recently, philosophers of science have become interested in mechanistic approaches to scientific explanation. Instead of appealing to laws, especially within the biological sciences, the new mechanists argue that scientists are able to provide a successful explanation by identifying and manipulating variables in a model of a mechanism thereby determining how those variables are situated in the mechanism. The explanation consists of explaining how those variables act and interact to produce the phenomenon of interest. So, models of mechanisms help scientists explain how a phenomenon is produced, how some task is carried out, and how the mechanism as a whole behaves. Contra the new mechanistic philosophy of science, I argue that, surprisingly, Wesley Salmon's 1984 Mark Transmission account, thought by some to be irrelevant for the biological sciences, in fact provides a more comprehensive approach to mechanistic explanations within the biological sciences. In chapter one, I outline current mechanistic approaches, and note the many favorable attributes of the current mechanistic accounts. However, there are some ways in which these accounts may be improved, such as the ability to handle contemporary complex biological systems, better incorporating the complexities of the mechanistic environment, offering explanations for ephemeral and irregular mechanisms, offering explanations for cases of negative causation, and offering illustrations of the mechanistic approach within contemporary scientific practice. In chapter two, I introduce the Salmon-Roe approach which considers mechanisms differently than the new mechanists, in that causal processes entering into causal interactions are what I refer to as mechanisms. Causal processes are the mechanisms that operate in our universe and are precisely what scientists trace and model during their research. Also, statistically relevant information regarding these causal processes is continually gathered by scientists and helps to provide generalized information that then becomes scientific knowledge. In this way, the Salmon-Roe approach offers an iterative and progressive picture of scientific explanation. By introducing and utilizing a contemporary mechanism of interest within the biological sciences throughout the dissertation, I show how one can rightfully and fruitfully utilize an enhanced version of Salmon's work to explain biological phenomena. I then argue, in chapter three, that accounts of mechanistic explanation ought to take more seriously the importance of the mechanism environment, especially when providing explanations for complex biological systems. To this end, I show how the Salmon-Roe approach properly magnifies the importance of mechanism environment both in explanation as well as scientific practice, provides a way in which to demarcate the mechanism from other external factors, and allows for a perspectival approach to mechanism levels that does not require that scientists decompose mechanisms into component parts. Chapter four is concerned with how the Salmon-Roe approach accounts for or results in scientific generalizations. I argued that scientists utilize particular experimental findings (token mechanism) and cluster that information alongside other relevantly similar token mechanisms. The result of this process is a robust mechanism taxonomy, or grouping of similar mechanisms then used to provide more general explanations. It is through this process, scientists are then able to construct generalizations. Finally, I argue, within chapter five, that other mechanistic accounts of explanation are ill-equipped to handle cases of negative causation. Conversely, negative causation cases are easily remedied when utilizing the Salmon-Roe notion of mechanisms, in that talk of negative causation always signals a different mechanism than we may have first thought. Once this is understood, we can shift our focus from the seemingly bewildering mechanism and focus on the appropriate mechanism that produces the appropriate phenomenon in question. In sum, by focusing on processes, rather than entities and activities, I argue that several problems that once plagued the new mechanists' approaches can be remedied. Within my dissertation I show how the Salmon-Roe approach to mechanistic explanations can solve problems regarding generalities, mechanism demarcation, reduction, regularity, negative causation, the mechanism environment, and scientific practice. The result is a revamped account of 'mechanism' that provides a better understanding of scientific explanation and scientific discovery.

Truth, Belief, and Inquiry: A New Theory of Knowledge

Author: Fleming, Forrest Shoup

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1557737832?accountid=14906

Abstract: My dissertation lies at the philosophical intersection of the American pragmatist tradition and contemporary epistemology. By treating truth, justification, and belief as matters of degree, I develop a measure of knowledge that captures all of our fundamental intuitions while providing answers to the problems of epistemic luck, skepticism, and scientific pessimism. Traditionally, knowledge is understood as justified true belief that is not due to luck. My project follows this general outline. First, I describe the pragmatist understanding of truth first articulated by Charles Sanders Peirce in the late nineteenth century. My first chapter offers Peirce's understanding of truth as the best explanation of our intuitive understanding of what it is for a proposition to be the case and shows how we can understand Peirce's theory as compatible with contemporary theories of truth. In my second chapter, I develop a theory of belief such that an agent believes a proposition when she acts as if that proposition were a rule governing her behavior. On this view, beliefs are theoretical entities posited to make sense of other agents' actions. Following this account of belief, I describe what it is for a belief to be true and argue that sense of truth in which beliefs are true is best understood as an approximation of the full descriptive truth. My third, fourth, and fifth chapters are an account of justification. Chapter 3 is a descriptive account of synchronic justification: we all reject or accept propositions in accordance with maximizing the coherence of our belief-networks. Chapters 4 and 5 articulate and then defend a new measure of diachronic justification, which is a measure of the degree to which a belief is appropriately revisable and therefore embeddable in an ongoing process of fallibilist inquiry. I develop a novel formal quantification of methodological justification and show that it gives plausible results when applied to popular cases. My final chapter brings justification, truth, and belief together into a scalar knowledge measure. I locate my theory in ongoing epistemic inquiry, describing its conceptual advantages over rival theories as well as its ability to replicate their successes.

From cell to subject: The rhetoric of freud's phylogenetic imagination in Beyond the Pleasure Principle

Author: Robertson, Aaron

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1508836382?accountid=14906

Abstract: The aim of this thesis, firstly, is to identify the dominate scholarly reactions to the biological writing of Sigmund Freud, particularly regarding his 1920 text, Beyond the Pleasure Principle. Considering the cluster of biological observations therein, now infamous for their anachronism, this study does not offer an index of Freud's scientific accuracy. Rather, I seek to explore the precarious relationship between two areas of investigation found in Beyond: the individual psyche and the development of the organism. Although psychoanalysis is often portrayed as primarily concerned with conflicts local to an individual's history, Freud so often portrays the tensions between the individual and his or her species as similarly important to human pathology, a notion explored in the first chapter. In the following chapter, I propose that Freud's biological imagination can be seen as less of a tangent to psychoanalytic theory once one identifies moments of its logical priority and originality. Some concepts in Freud's intellectual arsenal appear preconfigured by biological conjecture or fancy such as traumatic neurosis, which has a distinct evolutionary dilemma at the core of its formulization. Lastly, the trajectory of Freud's scientific speculation in Beyond is, issuing from its very design, intended for the enquiry of others. It is in this respect that I interrogate an ultimatum: is Freudian energetics merely an obscure metaphor to be interpreted or, as Jacques Lacan seems to suggest, a component of a theory of metaphoricity itself?

Probabilistic logic as a unified framework for inference

Author: Kane, Jonathan

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1638267922?accountid=14906

Abstract: I argue that a probabilistic logical language incorporates all the features of deductive, inductive, and abductive inference with the exception of how to generate hypotheses ex nihilo. In the context of abduction, it leads to the Bayes theorem for confirming hypotheses, and naturally captures the theoretical virtue of quantitative parsimony. I address common criticisms against this approach, including how to assign probabilities to sentences, the problem of the catch-all hypothesis, and the problem of auxiliary hypotheses. Finally, I make a tentative argument that mathematical deduction fits in the same probabilistic framework as a deterministic limiting case.

The epistemology of science: Acceptance, explanation, and realism

Author: Dellsen, Finnur

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1547167668?accountid=14906

Abstract: Natural science tells a story about what the world is like. But what kind of story is this supposed to be? On a popular (realist) view, this story is meant to provide the best possible explanations of the aspects of the world with which we are all acquainted. A realist also thinks that the story should in some sense provide explanations that are probable in light of our evidence, and that these explanations ought to fit together into a coherent whole. These requirements turn out to be surprisingly hard to satisfy given the received view of how scientific theories are evaluated. However, I argue that if scientific theories are evaluated comparatively rather than absolutely for explanatory purposes - optimifically rather than satisficingly - then we can provide a fully realist view of the connections between explanation, probability, and coherence. It is one thing to say what science's story of the world ought ideally be like, it is another to say that the story as it is actually being told lives up to this ideal. Do we have good reasons to believe that the picture as it is currently being presented to us is true, at least for the most part? "Yes," answer realists, "as long as our theories are empirically successful." Anti-realists respond that success is a poor guide to truth, appealing to the rather depressing history of successful theories that turned out to be false. Although I count myself among realists, I argue that realists have done themselves a disservice by focusing too much on empirical success in arguing for the correctness of the current scientific world-view. Instead I argue that one of the major reasons why currently accepted theories should (typically) be taken as true concerns the fact that they enjoy a certain kind of privileged status within scientific communities.

Integrating qualitative approaches into Dan McAdams's narrative research methodology

Author: Price, Benjamin R.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1640934679?accountid=14906

Abstract: This dissertation examines the relationship between philosophical assumptions, research methods, and the interpretation of findings in relation to narrative psychology. This discussion joins the longstanding debate regarding the veracity of quantitative and qualitative methods as ways to understand phenomena. Central to this issue are questions regarding the nature of reality, the definition of knowledge, and the nature of the relationship between observer and object. Researchers with a pragmatist philosophy assert that this debate is irrelevant because they believe that an appropriate criterion is whether the methods answer the research question (Blaikie, 2010, pp. 218-226); others disagree and argue that assumptions about the nature of reality shape and constrain all elements of the research process, which then constrains the interpretation of findings (McGrath & Johnson, 2003). This dissertation adopts the latter view. This issue is especially significant for narrative psychology research. Narrative is viewed as a way of knowing and as a way of making sense out of life experiences, so it is fundamentally connected to subjective experience. While many narrative researchers employ qualitative methods to describe subjective narrative accounts, there are others who have applied quantitative methods (e.g., null-hypothesis significance testing) to identify objective principles that can be generalized to larger populations (Lilgendahl & McAdams, 2011; McAdams et al., 2006). This dissertation critically examines Dan McAdams's (1996) methodology to demonstrate that the exclusive use of quantitative analysis for narrative texts imparts a framework for understanding the nature of reality, what knowledge is, and how it is obtained. This influences the types of questions asked as well as the types of information sought in narrative research. This dissertation explores the history of the quantitative and qualitative traditions to identify how the implicit epistemological assumptions within McAdams's framework constrain his methodology. This results in an incomplete understanding of narrative processes because of the limitations of quantitative data. This dissertation proposes modifications to McAdams's framework that will adequately account for the subjective features of narrative processes. This will provide a richer understanding of how interactive narrative processes impact individual lives.

A Thomistic exploration of the unity of Truth in the science and religion dialogue: Seeking oneness of the human experience

Author: Scott, Callum David

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1710724960?accountid=14906

Abstract: This study sets out to reclaim the ontological epistemology of Saint Thomas Aquinas which serves as a unifier of knowledge in being, within the philosophical milieu of being's forgottenness. Post-Humean and Kantian thought made appearance rather than being solely accessible to the thinking subject. The consequence has been the marginalisation of being as reflected in truth - influenced by scientistic and postmodern paradigms - which has contributed to both the paucity of meaningless metaphysics, and the conceptualisation of science and faith as necessarily opposing categories. To the end of establishing that science and faith have points of intersection, it is argued that the reclamation of Thomist natural philosophy leads to the defence of a clarified form of realism. Establishing the "real" implies that the metaphysical dimensions of the problem of existence can be explored. Within this realist model, the "pre-Modern" Thomistic theory of "scientia" is employed to bring physical and natural science and metaphysics into relationship as components of true knowledge of being. Consequently, the author puts forth that "scientia" is exemplified in, amongst others, the particular science of cosmology since the rudimentary point of engagement between physical and metaphysical science occurs in the act of creation, that is, when being comes into existence. Whilst metaphysics is often disregarded, it is consistently proposed that the causal nature of being demands - by its presence - a more robust account than physical and natural science can offer. The contribution made by this work rests in its ontologically-formed epistemic typology whereby "hard" science and faith are related in boundary areas of knowledge, that is, when metaphysical problems emerge from within physical and natural science. By reimaging "hard" science and reasonable faith within "scientia", both approaches are conceived as adequating to truth when their content is reflective of being.

Remembering without storing: Beyond archival models in the science and philosophy of human memory

Abstract: Models of memory in cognitive science and philosophy have traditionally explained human remembering in terms of storage and retrieval. This tendency has been entrenched by reliance on computationalist explanations over the course of the twentieth century; even research programs that eschew computationalism in name, or attempt the revision of traditional models, demonstrate tacit commitment to computationalist assumptions. It is assumed that memory must be stored by means of an isomorphic trace, that memory processes must divide into conceptually distinct systems and phases, and that human remembering consists in inner, cognitive processes that are implemented by distinct neural processes. This dissertation draws on recent empirical work, and on philosophical arguments from Ludwig Wittgenstein and others, to demonstrate that this latent computationalism in the study of memory is problematic, and that it can and should be eliminated. Cognitive psychologists studying memory have encountered numerous data in recent decades that belie archival models. In cognitive neuroscience, establishing the neural basis of storage and retrieval processes has proven elusive. A number of revised models on offer in memory science, that have taken these issues into account, fail to sufficiently extricate the archival framework. Several impasses in memory science are products of these underlying computationalist assumptions. Wittgenstein and other philosophers offer a number of arguments against the need for, and the efficacy of, the storage and retrieval of traces in human remembering. A study of these arguments clarifies the ways that these computationalist assumptions are presently impeding the science of memory, and provides ways forward in removing them. We can and should characterize and model human memory without invoking the storage and retrieval of traces. A range of work in connectionism, dynamical systems theory, and recent philosophical accounts of memory demonstrate how the science of memory can proceed without these assumptions, toward non-archival models of remembering.

Lessons for the future? Prophecy and policy in speculative bioethics

Author: Schick, Ari

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1520010178?accountid=14906

Abstract: For more than a decade, the field of bioethics has increasingly turned its attention to wide-ranging discussions of possible future biotechnologies, such as those that might be used to determine the genetic endowments of future offspring or to enhance existing people. Yet while the literature on human biomedical enhancement has become a focal point of bioethical debate, few of the technologies that stimulate this discourse have reached the point where they actually generate the ethical questions that the literature addresses. This study offers a comprehensive analysis and critique of speculative bioethics that builds on existing conceptualizations of two parallel modes of bioethical discourse (prophetic and regulatory), and draws from literature outside of bioethics that examines the social function of expectations regarding future technologies. I begin by tracing various developments in bioethics that have given rise to the enhancement discourse in its present form and survey some of the existing criticism that it has drawn. I demonstrate the ways in which speculative bioethics goes wrong when exploring potential future technologies and scenarios, and evaluate the utility of anticipatory bioethics research that attempts to get ahead of expected future technological developments. In the course of developing a robust theory of the nature and function of the prophetic and regulatory aspects of bioethics, I establish that speculative explorations belong within the domain of the prophetic, not regulatory, mode of bioethics. I expand the critique by examining the roles that technological expectations play in driving both biomedical research as well as public engagement with ethical issues in biomedicine. I argue that many existing ethical explorations of possible future technological scenarios mistakenly identify the object of ethical analysis as the actual possible future. Instead, it is the expectations that drive public discussion and research agendas that are the proper object of scrutiny and analysis. After probing the nature of this shortcoming and its consequences, I enlist alternative approaches that are capable of critically assessing the moral implications of technological expectations themselves. Finally, I develop an integrated approach for exploring the possible future technological scenarios found in speculative bioethics. Drawing on work in narrative ethics and the interface between literature and bioethics, I offer a multifaceted model of `narrative competence,' appropriate for analyzing the existing literature on human enhancement, as well as for pursuing alternatives that could better advance useful modes of bioethical discourse and public deliberation.

Lightning in a Bottle

Abstract: Climatology is a paradigmatic complex systems science. Understanding the global climate involves tackling problems in physics, chemistry, economics, and many other disciplines. I argue that complex systems like the global climate are characterized by certain dynamical features that explain how those systems change over time. A complex system's dynamics are shaped by the interaction of many different components operating at many different temporal and spatial scales. Examining the multidisciplinary and holistic methods of climatology can help us better understand the nature of complex systems in general. Questions surrounding climate science can be divided into three rough categories: foundational, methodological, and evaluative questions. "How do we know that we can trust science?" is a paradigmatic foundational question (and a surprisingly difficult one to answer). Because the global climate is so complex, questions like "what makes a system complex?" also fall into this category. There are a number of existing definitions of `complexity,' and while all of them capture some aspects of what makes intuitively complex systems distinctive, none is entirely satisfactory. Most existing accounts of complexity have been developed to work with information-theoretic objects (signals, for instance) rather than the physical and social systems studied by scientists. Dynamical complexity, a concept articulated in detail in the first third of the dissertation, is designed to bridge the gap between the mathematics of contemporary complexity theory (in particular the formalism of "effective complexity" developed by Gell-Mann and Lloyd [2003]) and a more general account of the structure of science generally. Dynamical complexity provides a physical interpretation of the formal tools of mathematical complexity theory, and thus can be used as a framework for thinking about general problems in the philosophy of science, including theories, explanation, and lawhood. Methodological questions include questions about how climate science constructs its models, on what basis we trust those models, and how we might improve those models. In order to answer questions about climate modeling, it's important to understand what climate models look like and how they are constructed. Climate model families are significantly more diverse than are the model families of most other sciences (even sciences that study other complex systems). Existing climate models range from basic models that can be solved on paper to staggeringly complicated models that can only be analyzed using the most advanced supercomputers in the world. I introduce some of the central concepts in climatology by demonstrating how one of the most basic climate models might be constructed. I begin with the assumption that the Earth is a simple featureless blackbody which receives energy from the sun and releases it into space, and show how to model that assumption formally. I then gradually add other factors (e.g. albedo and the greenhouse effect) to the model, and show how each addition brings the model's prediction closer to agreement with observation. After constructing this basic model, I describe the so-called "complexity hierarchy" of the rest of climate models, and argue that the sense of "complexity" used in the climate modeling community is related to dynamical complexity. With a clear understanding of the basics of climate modeling in hand, I then argue that foundational issues discussed early in the dissertation suggest that computation plays an irrevocably central role in climate modeling. "Science by simulation" is essential given the complexity of the global climate, but features of the climate system--the presence of non-linearities, feedback loops, and chaotic dynamics--put principled limits on the effectiveness of computational models. This tension is at the root of the staggering pluralism of the climate model hierarchy, and suggests that such pluralism is here to stay, rather than an artifact of our ignorance. Rather than attempting to converge on a single "best fit" climate model, we ought to embrace the diversity of climate models, and view each as a specialized tool designed to predict and explain a rather narrow range of phenomena. Understanding the climate system as a whole requires examining a number of different models, and correlating their outputs. This is the most significant methodological challenge of climatology. Climatology's role contemporary political discourse raises an unusually high number of evaluative questions for a physical science. The two leading approaches to crafting policy surrounding climate change center on mitigation (i.e. stopping the changes from occurring) and adaptation (making post hoc changes to ameliorate the harm caused by those changes). Crafting an effective socio-political response to the threat of anthropogenic climate change, however, requires us to integrate multiple perspectives and values: the proper response will be just as diverse and pluralistic as the climate models themselves, and will incorporate aspects of both approaches. I conclude by offering some concrete recommendations about how to integrate this value pluralism into our socio-political decision making framework.

The Thing Is All Around Itself

Abstract: What happens when a body of knowledge returns to the body from which it took off? What does it mean to study life through it's carcass? THE THING IS ALL AROUND ITSELF considers an 'island' from the perspective of Malaise, a flying insect trap that mimics the form of a human tent. The Malaise trap acts to passively involve insects by intercepting their flight path before funneling them into a bottle-neck chamber. This Thesis explores trap-setting as an alternative paradigm for artistic process, whilst the trap produced then functions as a non-euclidean frame through which to view the world - a klein-bottle space in which inside is always out.

A critique of the rejection of Intelligent Design as a scientific hypothesis by Elliott Sober from his book "Evidence and Evolution"

Author: LeMaster, James Charles

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1545888110?accountid=14906

Abstract: This dissertation critiques and rejects Elliott Sober's dismissal of intelligent design as a scientific hypothesis. Sober builds the case for this dismissal in chapter 2 of his 2008 book Evidence and Evolution. Sober's case against intelligent design as science is a philosophical one, emerging from a Bayesian likelihood approach. Sober claims that unlike neo-Darwinian processes, intelligent design cannot supply independent evidence to support the claim that it is a measurably likely cause responsible for the emergence of biological organisms and the structures or processes of which they are composed. Without an assessable likelihood, Sober asserts that intelligent design (again, unlike neo-Darwinian mechanisms) is not testable, and since it is not testable, it does not qualify as a scientific hypothesis. This dissertation argues however, that according to Sober's own standards in Evidence, because intelligent design and the neo-Darwinian hypothesis both address unrepeated, major biological changes in the unobservable past, and because they both depend upon crucial analogies in order to support either inductive arguments or likelihood assessments, the two hypotheses stand on equivalent evidential and logical grounds. Either Sober must reject both neo-Darwinism and intelligent design, or he must allow them both as equivalent, rival hypotheses based upon a fair application of his argumentation requirements. In addition, after explaining important basics of analogy theory, and its crucial, even unavoidable role in the historical (or "origins") sciences, the dissertation goes on to show how intelligent design's empirical support, based upon analogy with humanly designed artifacts, machines and increasingly cell-like creations in the laboratory, is continuing to grow stronger by the year in both likelihood and in explanatory power. The dissertation thus concludes that intelligent design should be treated as a viable scientific explanation for the dramatic examples of specified complexity being discovered in biology, and indeed should be regarded as an increasingly vigorous rival to the neo-Darwinian explanation of such complexity.

Examining Psychology's Approach to Understanding Proenvironmetnal Behaviors

Author: Lembaris, Michael S.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1640912551?accountid=14906

Abstract: The earth's ecosystems are being quickly degraded by human behaviors. Some ecosystems may soon lose their ability to support human life. As the science of behavior, psychology is obligated to contribute solutions to this problem. Most of the psychological research attempting to explain pro-environmental behavior is sociobehavioral. Sociobehavioral research has led some psychologists to advocate for contextual interventions as the best means for changing behavior. There are three problems with this conclusion. First, sociobehaviorism relies on research methods and explanatory concepts that underperform when applied to the domain of consciousness, leading to skewed data sets and biased conclusions. Second, contextual interventions are much too limited to cope with a problem as large and multifaceted as global environmental degradation. Third, contextual interventions ignore psychology's ethical obligation to increase personal freedom. Environmental degradation is a wicked problem, and wicked problems require a post-normal approach. The philosophy of post-normal science demonstrates that interacting with wicked problems requires the ability to relativize one's own perspective of a problem with a number of other valid interpretations. Wicked problems cannot be solved definitely. High stakes decisions must be made relative to consciously chosen values, not hopes for complete resolution of the problem situation. Constructive developmentalism is suggested as an alternative to sociobehaviorism. It effectively reorients psychology away from changing behavior through contextual intervention while recognizing the larger goal of facilitating capacity to care for self, others, and the natural world. Constructive developmentalism revolutionizes psychology's approach to increasing pro-environmental behaviors, and implies that major changes need to be made should psychology hope to significantly contribute to humanity's collective future. For example, the conceptual structure used by psychology to understand pro-environmental behaviors evolves, proenvironmental behaviors get defined differently, the model of intervention changes, and "solutions" or ideal end states to the problem morph. The new approach signified by constructive developmentalism can safely be conceived of as an evolution or development in thought because it subsumes (transcends and includes) the sociobehavioral emphasis on behavioral or contextual interventions in a wider, more agile framework.

Injurious speech, scientific boundaries, and institutional orthodoxy: The rhetoric of the vaccines-autism controversy

Author: Scott, Jennifer L.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1664003958?accountid=14906

Abstract: In 1998, Andrew Wakefield and his colleagues published a study in The Lancet that suggested the possibility of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Their suggestion sparked a controversy that persists today, despite numerous studies showing no evidence of a vaccines-autism link. The impact of Wakefield's now-discredited study raises questions about why some audiences find the notion of a vaccines-autism link compelling enough to refuse vaccination and risk the reemergence of once-rare diseases. To better understand the rhetorical dimensions of the controversy, I used generative rhetorical criticism to analyze five book-length artifacts about vaccines and autism. I sought to answer three research questions: (1) Are there significant patterns of argument that emerge among rhetors on different sides of the vaccines-autism controversy? (2) What lessons can be learned about the function of rhetoric in a public controversy about science? (3) What rhetorical strategies might effectively encourage beneficial health behaviors? My findings centered on three major categories: representations of autism, representations of science, and representations of institutions. First, I found that arguments for a vaccines-autism link framed autism in injurious terms that dehumanize autistic persons. Rhetors arguing against a link sometimes attempted to reframe autism as difference rather than disorder, but missed opportunities to challenge the narrative of autism as tragedy. These findings suggested a need for a more humane rhetoric of autism. Second, rhetors on either side of the controversy disagreed about scientific boundaries: what counts as evidence, which publications should be sanctioned by mainstream science, who has the expertise to do scientific work, and what science can and cannot achieve. Rhetors arguing for a vaccines-autism link seemed to misunderstand science's disciplinary boundaries, suggesting a need for educational endeavors that would encourage both scientific and rhetorical literacy. Third, rhetors who argued for a vaccines-autism link expressed suspicion toward institutions, accusing them of ineptitude, malice, and conspiracy. Although rhetors who argued against a link conceded that institutions are capable of and have committed errors, they seek to reaffirm institutional authority. My findings suggest that institutional failures invite defiance, and to address that defiance, institutions must engage in both discourses and actions deserving of trust.

The Meanings and Values of Race: Pluralism and Social Meliorism

Author: Fagiano, Mark

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1648430710?accountid=14906

Abstract: In chapter one, I explore various histories of Western science to uncover six common motifs of eighteenth century race science. In chapter two, I explain how this model of race-science was called into question and eventually replaced by another paradigm, a pre-Mendelian and Darwinian evolutionary model. By the mid-to-late nineteenth century, this evolutionary model established an entirely different idea of biological race marked by (a) a processional notion of species, (b) the use of different methods to determine what constitutes a "race" of people, (c) a definition of race based on the struggle for existence and natural selection, (d) morphology as a social sign of the strength or weakness of a race, and as a consequence, (e) the consideration that certain races--or a mixture of races--will contribute to the demise or degeneration of the best form of government. In chapter three, I explain a second epistemic break in scientific race studies, namely, a break from a pre-Mendelian evolutionary framework to one where the meaning of race is conceived from the perspective of the ; and further explicate the rise of a a linguistic-conceptual tendency called eliminativism. In chapter four, I turn to the emergence of a different linguistic-conceptual tendency and vision of melioration, referred to in the literature as retentionism or conservationism. In the final chapter, I offer an alternative to both eliminativism and retentionism by turning to the philosophical pragmatism of William James. I argue that four dynamics of James's thought, i.e., relationalism, radical empiricism/pluralism, pragmatism, and social meliorism are helpful for overcoming the limits of the discursive dilemma between eliminativism and retentionism. I then turn to explain a methodological approach I refer to as pragmatic contextualism. I conclude by examining the social practice of racial profiling and suggest that the value of race discourse ought to be judged by both its ameliorative aims and the social consequences it helps produce.

Color, cosmos, oculus: Vision, color, and the eye in Jacopo Zabarella and Hieronymus Fabricius ab Aquapendente

Author: Baker, Tawrin

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1637665046?accountid=14906

Abstract: The seventeenth century saw radical changes to theories of vision, light, color, matter, and knowledge about animal bodies. Understanding vision in the sixteenth century is essential to grasp these changes, but here many lacunae exist. Histories of vision have focused on mathematical optics and neglected color in natural philosophy and medicine. Historians of medicine have not sufficiently analyzed works on vision and color by physicians. Finally, historians of philosophy have produced few analyses of color theory from antiquity until 1600. My dissertation analyzes two highly important works on vision that have yet to be examined in detail by modern scholars: the natural philosopher Jacopo Zabarella's De visu, first published in his natural philosophy textbook De rebus naturalibus in 1590, and the physician and anatomist Hieronymus Fabricius ab Aquapendente's De visione, first published in 1600. Both taught at the University of Padua, at the time Europe's most prestigious medical school, and their stature and influence was considerable. Chapter 1 provides the history of one widely held theory of what color is and how it arises, which I dub the condensation theory of the origin of color. This theory arises from the Aristotelian commentary tradition with significant influences from astronomy, optics, and anatomy. This theory of color was closely intertwined with an Aristotelian cosmology, and is found in fully developed form in AverroÃ«s. Chapter 2 analyzes book 1 of Zabarella's De visu, where we find the most rigorous and complete explication of this theory in its history. Chapter 3 is an analysis of Fabricius's De visione, which combines anatomy, natural philosophy, and mathematical optics. Chapter 4 examines the shared, novel theory of vision held by Zabarella and Fabricius, and argues that they interacted across disciplinary lines in forming it. Chapter 5 demonstrates Zabarella's and Fabricius's influence on highly important figures for seventeenth-century optics and visual theory, such as Johannes Kepler, FranÃ§ois AguilÃ3n, and Christoph Scheiner; it argues for a revision to current narratives about the reception of the retinal theory of vision; and it addresses some major misconceptions about transformations to theories of vision and sensation in the seventeenth century.

Meeting the needs of homeless veterans: A case study

Author: Johnson, Ernestine R.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1513244038?accountid=14906

Abstract: The purpose of the qualitative multiple case study was to understand and describe leadership experiences of nonprofit leaders and managers. Examining the leadership traits of adaptive leadership, change leadership, transformation leadership, and complex adaptive leadership provided the platform of this study is an endeavor to understand nonprofit leadership from the perspective of service delivery and programs for homeless veterans. In addition, this study seeks to understand the complex problems of the homeless veteran population specifically of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars through the lens of nonprofit leadership. This qualitative multiple case study seeks to illuminate the motivational strategies and tactics of nonprofit leaders and managers to engage homeless veterans to pursue access to certain Veterans Administration services and programs. The main source for the multiple case study data included the narratives from the semi-structured interviews of four nonprofit executives in Indiana with years of experience with the homeless veteran population as well as veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. The knowledge and experience of the key executives of the four nonprofit organizations in the research study of the homeless veteran population made invaluable contributions to the qualitative multiple case study in the field of nonprofit leadership. The findings of the qualitative multiple case study were generally consistent with the existing studies relative to the homeless veteran population. Through the illumination of the thick, rich descriptions of the shared experiences of the nonprofit leaders and manager of the qualitative multiple case study called attention to the linkage with the literature to provide an explanation of the inability of homeless veterans to gain access to certain Veterans Administration services and programs. Thus, the current qualitative multiple case study begins to fill the gaps in the scientific knowledge base to resolve issues of the unmet needs of homeless veterans.

Dredging Evolutionary Theory: the emergence of the deep sea as a transatlantic site for evolution, 1853-1876

Author: Alaniz, Rodolfo John

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1650657148?accountid=14906

Abstract: Marine invertebrate specimens from the ocean floor played a large role in the formation of evolutionary theory and they continued to help men of science adjudicate natural selection later into the nineteenth century. By 1880, the deep ocean floor had become "Darwin's laboratory," a place to test the "direct action of external conditions on organisms." According to dominant Victorian marine biology, the deep sea was an eternal, unchanging biogeographical space. There, and only there, could naturalists investigate how organisms evolved without the influence of changing environmental factors. The ocean floor was also a politically-charged geographical location, as colonial trade networks relied upon accurate mapping of the sea floor to ensure the safety of merchant and naval fleets. This dissertation explores the emergence of the deep-sea floor as a contested space where science, practice, and politics became inextricably linked. One result of that entanglement was a challenge to Darwinian natural selection prompted by marine invertebrate specimens. Governmental and non-governmental organizations from Britain and America joined the battle over natural selection. This story illuminates ways in which the geographical location of an investigation can have long-lasting consequences on international policies, scientific discourse, and biological theories.

A hermeneutic exploration of and proposed solution to the schism between researchers and clinicians in psychology

Author: Green, Mark S.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1621504635?accountid=14906

Abstract: Fragmentation in the field of psychology has persisted throughout its history (Slife, 2000). One example of this fragmentation is the gap between researchers and clinicians (Teachman, Drabick, Hershenberg, Vivian, & Wolfe 2012). Although many attempts have been made to bridge this gap, there is still no consensus regarding its resolution. This dissertation provides an explanation for the gap at the philosophical level and provides a method for communicating across potentially incommensurable philosophies, based on Gadamer's (1960/1989) hermeneutic opus: Truth and Method.

Animal Models and the Unity of Neuroscience

Author: Atanasova, Nina Atanasova

Abstract: Contemporary neurobiology abounds with multiple experimental protocols and procedures aiming to study identical phenomena. This state of affairs seems to put in jeopardy the integration of experimental results and the extrapolation of laboratory knowledge to natural world phenomena. The problem is further complicated when knowledge produced through animal experimentation is extended to humans. My thesis is that the multiplicity of protocols fosters rather than precludes progress in neurobiology. It is especially valued when the results of different experiments converge. In these cases, the validity of knowledge claims increases. Converging experimental results get integrated. To date, no comprehensive philosophical analysis of animal experimentation in neurobiology exists. For this reason I analyze the functions of animal models in experimental neurobiology. I argue that even though animal models are related to model and experimental organisms, in the case of neurobiology, they are better conceptualized as experimental systems rather than as a subclass of the other two classes of biological models. In a case study, I trace the developments of and the variations on the basic design of Morris water maze experiments to exemplify the motivation for producing variations on basic experimental protocols. Ultimately, I defend a view of the structure of experimental neurobiology which I call optimistic pluralism. It is an extension of the so called perspectival pluralism according to which the integration of multiple partial perspectives employed in the study of any given phenomenon maximizes the knowledge about this phenomenon. It is optimistic because it justifies the possibility for multiple partial perspectives to converge and be integrated in order to provide knowledge about complex phenomena. This view justifies the desirability of multiple experimental protocols in contemporary neurobiology because it values the multiplicity of perspectives they provide.

Models in scientific practice

Author: Ishida, Yoichi

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1644826242?accountid=14906

Abstract: This dissertation presents an account of the practice of modeling in science in which scientists' perceptual and bodily interactions with external representations take center stage. I argue that modeling is primarily a practice of constructing, manipulating, and analyzing external representations in service of cognitive and epistemic aims of research, and show that this account better captures important aspects of the practice of modeling than accounts currently popular in philosophy of science. Philosophical accounts of the practice of modeling classify models according to the categories of abstract and concrete entities developed in metaphysics. I argue that this type of account obscures the practice of modeling. In particular, using the analysis of the Lotka-Volterra model as an example, I argue that understanding mathematical models as abstract entities--non-spatiotemporally located, imperceptible entities--obscures the fact that the analysis of the Lotka-Volterra model relies primarily on visual perception of external representations, especially hand- or computer-generated graphs. Instead, I suggest that we apply the concepts of internal and external representations, developed in cognitive science, to models, including mathematical models. I then present two case studies that illustrate different aspects of modeling, understood as a practice of constructing, manipulating, and analyzing external representations. First, using Sewall Wright's long-term research on isolation by distance, I articulate the relationship between the uses of a model, the particular aims of research, and the criteria of success relevant to a given use of the model. I argue that uses of the same model can shift over the course of scientists' research in response to shifts in aim and that criteria of success for one use of a model can be different from those for another use of the same model. Second, I argue that in successful scientific research, a scientist uses a model according to the methodological principles of realism and instrumentalism despite the tension that they create among the scientist's uses of the model over time. This thesis is supported by a detailed analysis of successful scientific research done by Seymour Benzer in the 1950s and 60s.

Biochemical kinds and selective naturalism

Author: Havstad, Joyce Catherine

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1524023369?accountid=14906

Abstract: In this dissertation I show how the complexity of biological and chemical kinds often complicates attempts to classify these kinds. I construct an account--which I call 'selective naturalism'--that explains the diverse yet grounded classification of complex biochemical objects like proteins. By distinguishing the properties and powers of these complex objects, as well as the inferences afforded by tracking sets of these properties and powers via classification, I can explain how various classificatory complications evident in the biological and chemical sciences are generated. I can also show how this kind of classification may be used as a tool for discovery in the sciences.

A singularity of hope: The implications of a phenomenal theory of cognition for the focus of philosophical artificial intelligence research

Author: Imai, Derek

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1612494806?accountid=14906

Abstract: There are a host of philosophical assumptions that undergird the artificial intelligence project. One assumption is a reductionist view of the person wherein humans are considered nothing more than biochemical computers. This assumption generates some significant philosophical problems as it necessitates a purely naturalistic explanation of phenomena such as intentionality, agency and consciousness. In this paper, we will explore two attempts to naturalize intentionality as well as consider the implications a phenomenal theory of cognition would have for those attempts. From this, we will then turn our attention to the artificial intelligence project and make some recommendations as to where philosophical research should focus in efforts to advance the discussion surrounding the potential success of artificial intelligence as well as the nature of mind itself.

Scientism, Satire, and Sacrificial Ceremony in Dostoevsky's Notes From Underground and C.S. Lewis's That Hideous Strength

Author: Smalt, Jonathan

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1540737320?accountid=14906

Abstract: Though the nineteenth-century Victorian belief that science alone could provide utopia for man weakened in the epistemological uncertainty of the postmodern era, this belief still continues today. In order to understand our current scientific milieu--and the dangers of propagating scientism--we must first trace the rise of scientism in the nineteenth-century. Though removed, Fyodor Dostoevsky, in Notes From Underground (1864), and C.S. Lewis, in That Hideous Strength (1965), are united in their critiques of scientism as a conceptual framework for human residency. For Dostoevsky, the Crystal Palace of London's Great Exhibition (1862) embodied the nineteenth-century goal to found utopia through the means of scientific progress. Though the Crystal Palace offers this hope for man, Dostoevsky shows that palace's monological design is ultimately uninhabitable for humans, who are dialogical beings. Writing a century later, Lewis explores the implications of scientism within the National Institute for Coordinated Experiments (otherwise known as the N.I.C.E.), which offers the same conceptual framework as the Crystal Palace. Like Dostoevsky, Lewis exposes the monological myth of scientism and both present hearty critiques of scientism as a way of life for man. They use satire, exaggeration, and wit to show the absurdity of a conceptual framework built on the foundations of a naturalistic philosophy of science.

The foundations and methods of classical political science

Author: Sebell, Dustin

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1613241359?accountid=14906

Abstract: This dissertation is an attempt to understand and assess the presuppositions and methods of classical political science. In the first of its two parts, the dissertation examines the meaning of the traditional view, held by authorities as far removed from one another as Cicero and Hobbes, that Socrates was the founder of political philosophy. It does so by considering the intellectual autobiography that Socrates famously delivers in Plato's Phaedo . Socrates turned to the study of pre-scientific, common-sense moral and political opinions only after he had rejected, as a very young man, both the materialist and the teleological natural science of his philosophic predecessors. It is the task of the dissertation's first part to show how the general revolution in scientific thought presented in the Phaedo , a revolution known as "the Socratic turn," laid the theoretical groundwork for classical political philosophy's characteristic focus on pre-scientific, common-sense moral distinctions. After examining "the Socratic turn," the dissertation then outlines in its second part the approach to the study of politics that Aristotle advanced on the basis of it. In particular, Aristotle's statements on the method of political science in book I of the Ethics are shown to rely on the basic insights obtained through "the turn."

Epistemic and Nonepistemic Values in Psychiatric Explanation and Classification

Author: Kostko, Aaron T.

Abstract: My dissertation addresses two longstanding debates in the philosophy of psychiatry: the debate between objectivists and evaluativists regarding the relative significance of factual descriptions and evaluative judgments in attributions of psychiatric disorder and the debate between reductionists and pluralists over whether explanations of psychiatric disorders should proceed at a single level or multiple levels of explanation. The standard way to distinguish philosophical accounts of psychiatric disorder is in terms of the relative significance they grant to factual descriptions of abnormal functioning and evaluative judgments of this abnormal functioning. I argue that this way of categorizing philosophical accounts is overly simplistic and that a more fruitful approach is to focus on the role of epistemic and nonepistemic evaluative judgments in the contexts of psychiatric diagnosis, classification, and research. Using debates regarding the diagnostic criteria for diagnoses of Bipolar Disorder, I highlight the interaction between epistemic and nonepistemic value judgments and argue that the latter play a legitimate role in decisions regarding the relative risks of false positive and false negative diagnoses and whether to draw an inference quickly or wait for further evidence to reduce uncertainties. I show how this approach provides for a more straightforward comparison of the various accounts of psychiatric disorder by making explicit the role and type of evaluative judgments that are either ignored or often tacitly assumed by each account. The second half of my dissertation focuses on the debate between reductionists and pluralists. I outline and evaluate five specific reductionist theses within the philosophy of psychiatry literature: 1) ontological reductionism, 2) eliminative reductionism, 3) methodological reductionism, 4) epistemological reductionism, and 5) causal reductionism. I argue that eliminative, epistemological, and causal reductionism will likely not be borne out by the empirical evidence and that only ontological reductionism, characterized as a general commitment to physicalism, and methodological reductionism are consistent with the current evidence and explanatory aims of psychiatry. I then consider why reductionism has received so much attention and criticism despite the fact that there is no author who explicitly defends the view. I attribute this focus on reductionism to recent proposals to synthesize psychiatry with neuroscience. However, I argue that these proposals advocate nothing more than a general commitment to physicalism and a localized version of methodological reductionism and, therefore, that concerns about reductionist trends in psychiatry and the alleged harms associated with such trends are unwarranted. Pragmatism and pluralism are often defended as alternatives to reductionism in psychiatry. I examine three proposals for incorporating pragmatism into psychiatry and argue that they all fail to provide specific guidance as to how pragmatic considerations should influence decisions regarding psychiatric diagnosis and classification. I then examine proposals for incorporating empirically based pluralism and explanatory pluralism into psychiatry and argue that each view fails to fully address the problem of how to determine the relative explanatory significance of various levels of explanation. I argue that one can only address these shortcomings if one acknowledges a role of nonepistemic value judgments and that the inclusion of such judgments is the inevitable consequence of recognizing the complexity of psychiatric disorders and the provisional nature of psychiatric classification and explanation.

The non-ending search for a pre-DNA replicator: Richard Dawkins and the problem of abiogenesis

Author: Fryar, Randall Scott

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1541535695?accountid=14906

Abstract: This dissertation provides a rebuttal to the claims of Richard Dawkins in explaining the origin of life. The bulk of the ensuing analysis challenges his philosophical assumptions as it notes his vacillation between several models over time. The study further details Dawkins's multifaceted approach to the problem as it points out a number of errors permeating his general methodology and reasoning.

Chance in evolutionary theory: Fitness, selection, and genetic drift in philosophical and historical perspective

Author: Pence, Charles H.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1547351149?accountid=14906

Abstract: Discussions of the foundations of evolutionary theory - especially natural selection, fitness, and genetic drift - are saturated with terms referring to various kinds of chance, stochasticity, randomness, unpredictability, and so forth. This dissertation examines these uses of chance in philosophical and historical perspective. I begin by arguing that, both in the contemporary and historical arenas, the current state of the literature on chance is deeply troubling. Work in the philosophy of biology (i) often conflates various clearly distinct notions of chance, and (ii) often approaches the analysis of chance from the perspective of a debate (on the causal potency of natural selection and genetic drift) that does not in fact profitability engage evolutionary theory. Historically, as well, the most common way of analyzing the development of the use of chance in evolutionary theory does not engage the actual research of historical actors, a point I make by exploring the work of Karl Pearson and W.F.R.Weldon at the turn of the twentieth century. I thus propose a new guiding question for research into the role of chance in evolutionary theory: what is the relationship between our statistical biological theories and the processes in the world those theories aim to describe? I then offer a novel framework for determining the answer to this question, derived from a deeply biologically-informed understanding of fitness, selection, and drift. This view combines core insights from work in philosophy on the propensity interpretation of fitness with cutting-edge biological treatments of population modeling. Chance enters this model at only a single point - the distribution over the various possible lives that an organism might live - and this single source can explain the influence of chance throughout fitness, natural selection, and genetic drift. This framework, I claim, constitutes a fruitful way to understand both the foundations of evolutionary theory and the role of chance in those foundations.

Consciousness and mental quotation: An intrinsic higher-order account

Author: Picciuto, Vincent J.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1558874322?accountid=14906

Abstract: The guiding thought of this dissertation is that phenomenally conscious mental states consist in an appropriate pair of first-order and higher-order representations that are uniquely bound together by mental quotation. In slogan form: to be conscious is to be mentally quoted. Others before me have entertained the idea of mental quotation, but they have done so with the aim of putting mental quotation to work as part of the "phenomenal concept strategy" (Papineau, 2000; Balog, Block, 2006; Balog 2012). Their purpose was importantly different from mine. According to those theorists, mental quotation is entirely introspective. On their views, a mental quotation is supposed to be a unique concept that we sometimes use to think about our own conscious states. Conscious states are assumed to be already conscious in virtue of some independent factor, or factors. Mental quotations are not supposed to be that in virtue of which conscious states are conscious. In contrast, this dissertation proposes that mentally quoting an appropriate first-order state is what makes a conscious state conscious in the first-place. Treating consciousness as existing in a higher-order thought that mentally quotes first-order sensory contents has immediate explanatory dividends. It explains several of the classic puzzles of consciousness as well as solving a set of puzzles to which existing higher-order theorists fail to respond. This includes what many see as an insurmountable problem for existing views: the problem of higher-order misrepresentation. If the higher-order component of a conscious state is quotation-like, the gap is filled between the state represented and the higher-order state that makes the state conscious. Rather than targeting a numerically distinct state from afar, as an extrinsic higher-order representation does, a mental quotation latches onto the very target state itself. The target state is enveloped and thereby becomes a component of the higher-order state, and it is the complex, the quotational state as a whole, that is the conscious state. What emerges from the guiding thought is a novel self-representational (or intrinsic higher-order) model of consciousness, described at the intentional level, which is immune to challenges facing existing views.

All at one point: The new physics of Italo Calvino and Jorge Luis Borges

Author: Rinaldi, Mark T.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1629480770?accountid=14906

Abstract: This work of comparative literary criticism focuses on the presence of mathematical and scientific concepts and imagery in the works of Italo Calvino and Jorge Luis Borges, beginning with an historical overview of scientific philosophy and an introduction to the most significant scientific concepts of the last several centuries, before shifting to deep, scientifically-driven analyses of numerous individual fictions, and finally concluding with a meditation on the unexpectedly fictive aspects of science and mathematics. The close readings of these authors' fictions are contextualized with thorough explanations of the potential literary implications of theories from physics, mathematics, neuroscience and chaos theory. While the mathematical studies highlight concepts such as "Zeno's Paradox," Cantorian set theory, and representations of numerical infinity, the discussions of physics isolate theoretical structures such as black holes, parallel universes and quantum-entangled particles for use in discussing the fictions of both authors. Underlying the main goals of this work is an equal focus on the existence of an "ideal intellectual" or, more broadly, an ideal liberal arts education that draws together concepts from diverse and seemingly-unrelated fields of knowledge with the intention of generating unexpected and novel ideas and connections. By demonstrating the numerous appearances of scientific and mathematical imagery in the works of Calvino and Borges, this work emphasizes the shared fictive basis of all human knowledge and strives to set science and fiction alongside each other as equals in the hope of preserving the richness and diversity of intellectual enterprises.

A philosophical examination of Aristotle's "Historia Animalium"

Author: Bemer, Keith

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1644825799?accountid=14906

Abstract: In this dissertation I address two related questions pertaining to Aristotle's philosophy of science and his biology and zoology. They are: (1) what are the goals of Aristotle's Historia Animalium (HA) and how does the treatise achieve these goals? And, more generally, (2) what is the role of a historia in Aristotle's philosophy of science? Together these questions touch upon a long recognized problem in the interpretation of Aristotle's philosophical and scientific works related to the relationship between Aristotle's philosophy of science and his actual scientific practice. I pursue this broad question by focusing my attention on Aristotle's historia of animals and the related discussions of scientific investigation and demonstration, primarily in the Analytics . I argue that the term historia was used by Aristotle with a range of meanings that center around the notions of investigation and inquiry (or the reports thereof), and, in some instances, emphasize the early stages of inquiry, dedicated to establishing and organizing facts prior to causal explanation. I proceed by considering the theoretical background of a historia provided by the Analytics and Parts of Animals , before turning to a detailed analysis of select passages from the HA itself. I argue that the Analytics provides the framework for a method of correlating facts regarding a field of study that acts as a guide to further causal research, but that establishing the actual causal relations that hold within a field depends upon additional considerations that are largely domain-specific. I turn to the HA in order to illustrate this method of correlation, noting examples where the correlation of features appears to prefigure causal explanations. I conclude by considering the relationship between Aristotle's notions of historia and experience ( empeiria ), and argue that a historia provides the sort of comprehensive, factual knowledge of a domain of study that Aristotle often notes is necessary for coming to recognize causal relations, and thus coming to have scientific knowledge ( epistêmê ).

Abstract: Francis Bacon is one of the architects of the modern conception of scientific method. Yet Bacon's corpus remains little studied and poorly understood. My dissertation is an account of his method with a focus on his reasons for believing that the it enables us to acquire knowledge of the nature of things (i.e., of forms) and thereby to establish causal claims with epistemic certainty. It thus has both an interpretive and an evaluative dimension. By way of a new interpretation of Bacon's method, I defend him against those who have too casually dismissed his aspirations to certainty as a result of their reading him through deductivist or falsificationist lenses. I reconstruct Bacon's method beginning with its foundation in sense-perception. I argue that Bacon (despite his remarks on the faults of the senses, which other interpreters have overemphasized) takes the side of the Epicureans against ancient skeptics. He holds that all sense-perceptions are true, by which he means that they always causally register mind-independent objects. I then argue that Bacon's aspirations for certainty in natural history hinge on his moderate empiricist foundationalism. Part of his account is an original analysis of the self-correcting character of science, according to which erroneous instances in a natural history are eliminated over time as a result of their conflicting with conclusions overwhelmingly supported by the rest of the instances. The guarantee that sporadic errors can be corrected in time is an important element in being able to secure certainty about forms. The culmination of my interpretation is a discussion of Baconian induction, which is usually understood in deductivist terms as a form of eliminative induction. I argue for an alternative interpretation which emphasizes the non-eliminative role of Bacon's prerogative instances. Although the method that I describe should be subjected to further scrutiny, not even Bacon believed that he had the last word to say on scientific methodology; he viewed his method as an inductive discovery which would have to be revised. Accordingly, I offer Bacon's method as a promising approach which contains within itself the resources to further expand its heuristic and justificatory power.

Historicizing Anti-Racism: UNESCO's Campaigns Against Race Prejudice in the 1950s

Author: Gil-Riano, Sebastian

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1634504976?accountid=14906

Abstract: This dissertation offers a revised historical account of how scientific experts associated with the United Nations Education Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in the post-WWII era sought to overcome the legacy of scientific racism. Situating UNESCO's anti-racism initiatives within the geographic context of the South and North Atlantic and the intellectual context of Latin American, Francophone, and Anglo-American social science this study shows that mid-century discussions of 'race' were intertwined with the multiple narratives of modernization and societal change that emerged in tandem with decolonization and the Cold War. Thus, one of this dissertation's key arguments is that anti-racist projects in the post-war era were often cast as projects of redemption that involved coming to terms with the painful and destructive legacy of scientific racism and the anticipation of an improved and harmonious future where 'race' did not figure as a source of conflict and tension. However, because mid-century anti-racist scientists hailed from a variety of cultural, linguistic, and racial backgrounds the question of redemption took on different meanings and involved different stakes. This study examines social science experts' anti-racist narratives of redemption in the context of four different UNESCO initiatives from the 1950s: 1) in projects of 'cultural change' (which were predicated on the anti-racist notion of the inherent educability of all peoples) 2) in UNESCO's study of race relations in various locations in Brazil 3) in the elaboration of anti-racist approaches to ethnographic observation, and 4) in UNESCO attempts to produce anti-racist handbooks for teachers. These projects reveal how anti-racist experts from the 1950s were very much haunted by 'race' and concerned with neutralizing and dampening the affective and political impact of racial conceptions in the geopolitics of post-war era. Thus, this dissertation argues that rather than indicating a definitive retreat from 'race' UNESCO's anti-racism initiatives in the 1950s speak to the persistence and plasticity of 'race' and of the fraught attempts to escape its legacy.

Il Gusto della Modernita: Aesthetics, nation, and the language of food in 19th century Italy

Author: De Feo, Daniele

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1524956067?accountid=14906

Abstract: My dissertation " Il Gusto della Modernità : Aesthetics, Nation and the Language of Food in 19 th century Italy," explores the cohesive pedagogic and nationalistic attempt to define Italian taste during the instability of an unificatory Italy. Initiating with an establishing European taste paradigm (e.g. Feuerbach, Fourier, Brillat-Savarin), my research demonstrates that there is an increasing number of works composed within the developing "Italian" context, which reflects and participates in the construction and the consumption of a national identity (e.g., Rajberti, Mantegazza, Guerrini, Artusi). Conversely, this budding taste genre finds itself in sharp contrast to the economic paucity and social divisiveness endured by a large sector of the populace and depicted by the literature of the day (e.g., Collodi, Verga, Serao). It is precisely this lack of confluence between that which is scientific and literary that marks this process of taste ennoblement and indoctrination, defining more than ever the nuances that encompass il gusto italiano .

Essays on Biological Individuality

Author: Booth, Austin Greeley

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1625429020?accountid=14906

Abstract: Much of biology, especially evolutionary theory, makes assumptions about the individuality of living things. A population, for example, is made up of individuals. Those individuals sometimes reproduce, creating new individuals. The very use of these concepts requires that living individuals can be distinguished both synchronically and diachronically. There are many examples in nature, however, in which a living system is present, but it is not clear how to understand that system's individuality. Plants, fungi, colonial marine invertebrates, insect colonies, and symbiosis are all classic cases that have puzzled biologists interested in understanding their population structure and evolution. Scientific exploration of these issues has connections with traditional philosophical terrain, particularly the ontology of persistence and the nature of individuality broadly construed. A biologically informed philosophical literature has arisen in recent years, aimed at understanding the nature of biological individuality and its role in biological theorizing. My dissertation makes two kinds of contributions to this current literature. One contribution is theoretical, reframing our thinking about biological individuality. I distinguish between two categories of individuality and argue that they play different roles in theorizing about nature. One important kind of individual is that of the organism, understood as an entity that persists through space and time, takes in and processes resources from the environment, and maintains physiological autonomy. Another important kind of individual is that of the evolutionary individual, understood as an entity that has the capacity to participate in processes of natural selection. Distinguishing between these two types of individuality has theoretical utility, keeping clear the distinctive kinds of biological processes that individuals engage in. The other contribution of my dissertation involves detailed natural historical analysis of three kinds of problem cases. Using the framework articulated earlier in the dissertation, I assess the individuality of symbioses between larger organisms and their microbial associates, mushroom-producing fungi, and the classic case of ant colonies. The combined result of the assessments is a hierarchical pluralism about biological individuality.

A New Machine For Thinking: Historical Epistemology in Twentieth Century France

Author: Cauvin, Jean-Paul

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1560897124?accountid=14906

Abstract: The dissertation is an historical and philosophical examination of the epistemology of science in France between 1905 (the year Einstein [1879-1955] published the quartet of papers including the germinal formulation of the special theory of relativity) and 1971 (the year Georges Canguilhem [1901-1995] retired as the director of the Institut d'Histoire des Sciences et des Techniques), dates which I argue bookend the emergence of an epistemological tradition which Dominique Lecourt (1944 -) has dubbed "historical epistemology." I argue that, within this time frame (1905-1971), a methodological consensus emerges within French philosophy according to which the epistemological norms used to evaluate the validity of scientific knowledge must be continually revised in order to account for the historical transformation of scientific concepts and methods. I argue that two consequences proceed from this basic methodological program which have largely escaped critical notice in the Anglo-American and Francophone scholarship devoted to the subject. The first concerns a transformation of the implicit norms guiding epistemological critique. Unlike the Positivist or Neo-Kantian projects of the nineteenth century, the tradition of historical epistemology systematically rejects predetermined theories of the developmental logic of science, on the one hand, (Positivist historiography of science), and the transcendental determination of epistemic normativity on the other (Neo-Kantian Wissenschaftslehre ). The second concerns a transformation of the epistemological status of the history of science itself. The tradition rejects the history of science as a stable configuration, indeed, I argue that a sophisticated historiographical method unites the historical epistemologists in a common project whereby the writing of the history of science becomes a task that must be perpetually renewed. The dissertation has two primary aims. 1) To demonstrate the theoretical consistency of the tradition by determining the nature and function of the normative epistemological commitments which organize its concepts and methodologies, and, in so doing, to contribute to the history of philosophy in twentieth century France and to the history of the philosophy of science. 2) To reconstruct the variable histories of philosophy and of science which the historical epistemologists produce as the result of the epistemological determination of the nature of scientific rationality.

Developing and Testing an Ecosocial Model of Tobacco Cessation Service Utilization

Author: Dearfield, Craig Thomas

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1620833636?accountid=14906

Abstract: This project was conducted to measure the influences of individual, social, environmental, and macro political and economic factors on individual decision-making by focusing on the utilization of tobacco cessation services. It relied on the social epidemiological methods and Krieger's Ecosocial theory to describe the multiple levels of factors that influence health behaviors and outcomes. The study sought to contextualize individual behavior by developing and testing a multi-level model of tobacco cessation service usage behaviors. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was conducted to estimate the proportion of variance in cessation service utilization predicted by the influences of individual, social, and neighborhood factors. Individual factors included past smoking behaviors, basic health history, and demographics and background. Contextual factors included social network variables, such as social support and social exposure to smoking behaviors and conditions, and neighborhood variables, including neighborhood disadvantage, neighborhood health status, and tobacco retail density. The investigator collected data from several sources, including from individual surveys, the Washington, DC government data clearinghouse, the Census, and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). These data sources were merged into a multilevel analytic data set using ArcGIS to link geographic information in each data set. HLM findings showed that the following individual factors (respondent's intentions to quit, socioeconomic status, medical trust, pack years, gender, and marital status) and contextual factors (overall social support, social exposure to smoking-related behaviors and illnesses, and tobacco retail density) were important predictors of tobacco cessation service utilization. Individual factors accounted for about 80 percent of the total explained variance in tobacco cessation service utilization across the HLM analyses conducted in this study, and contextual factors accounted for about 20 percent of the explained variance in tobacco cessation service utilization. These results indicate that an individual's context has an important effect on the use of tobacco cessation services. The results may inform future research and interventions on the individual and contextual factors that are most salient in helping people quit smoking.

The predictive focus account of the principle of simplicity

Author: Sharber, Justin

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1655001139?accountid=14906

Abstract: This dissertation presents an account of the Principle of Simplicity, a prominent idea in the philosophy of science. The principle states that when a simple model and a complex model both predict the data, and all else is equal, the data supports the simpler model more. The account, the "Predictive Focus Account," states that simpler models are better confirmed in these contexts because they make narrower, more focused predictions. The introduction presents Principle of Simplicity and the Predictive Focus Account. It defines key terms and explains the dissertation's methodology. This section also flags background issues that go beyond the scope of the dissertation. Chapter 1 investigates the philosophical history of the Predictive Focus Account, and the relationship between a model's simplicity and its "global likelihood." On this account, the explanation of the advantage of simplicity is grounded in relations of Bayesian confirmation between competing models. That is, the advantage of simplicity is a subtle, but inherent, feature of standard Bayesian model evaluation. This chapter argues that the Predictive Focus Account is incomplete without a method for fixing prior probabilities. It proposes a new approach to fixing objective priors, the "Data Window Prior," grounded in experimental design. The proposed prior bounds the parameters of statistical models and reigns in their predictions, which are a priori unbounded and infinitely extended. So bounded, the models have definite prediction ranges and corresponding degrees of predictive focus. I apply the Data Window Prior to the historical case of Hubble's Law from cosmology, yielding a powerful, intuitive verdict about the confirmation relations between models of varying degree of complexity. Chapter 2 contrasts the Predictive Focus Account with the more popular Bayesian method of "prior-stacking," whereby Bayesians privilege simpler models and hypotheses with higher prior probabilities. The Predictive Focus Account has distinct advantages over the prior-stacking approach: it shows how simplicity can be favored on a posteriori, empirical grounds, and how this favoring relation depends on the nature of the extant data. Chapter 3 contrasts my account with another, based in Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), a contemporary, non-Bayesian alternative. The AIC is a statistical model selection criterion that describes estimation error. It is designed to quantify and resist "over-fitting" the data with complex models. The main advantage of the Predictive Focus Account (and corresponding Bayesian method) is its generality. It applies to a wider range of cases and supports a broader range of inferences than the AIC.

Ethical Interanimality: An Essay in the Philosophy of Nature

Author: Ben-Meir, Sam

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1552484804?accountid=14906

Abstract: The aim of this dissertation is essentially twofold: First, to examine the development of the holistic understanding of living nature that stretches from Goethe to Merleau-Ponty, and includes such philosophically-inclined scientists as Kurt Goldstein, Adolf Portmann, and most especially Jakob von Uexküll. Second, to begin constructing a theory of ethical interanimality - that is, a holistic account of the animal that ultimately affirms the ways in which humans and animals are inseparable, ontologically intertwined and bringing forth ever new ways of being in the world. Chapter One argues that radical reductionism in biology fails to adequately consider, among other things, the existence of emergent entities and properties at higher levels of organization. It is suggested that not only does living nature tend towards novelty, but that the organism possesses an inner coherence or meaningfulness, which cannot be satisfactorily grasped as the product of mere chance. Chapter Two develops this theme further by drawing on the work of Goethe, and the science of morphology that he invented as a way of approaching the form of the organism as a whole. The task of morphology is to grasp the living unity and coherence of the organism in its development - that is, diachronically. In Chapter Two, we also find that Goethe anticipates Uexküll, inasmuch as he insists upon viewing the animal holistically, with necessary connections that result in an intrinsically intelligible structure. Chapter Three examines Uexküll's contributions to theoretical biology and biosemiotics: it argues that his Kantianism is excessive; and that the investigation of the animal's surrounding-world does not only inform us as to the functional patternings of the organism, but also tells us something about the essential features of Nature itself. In the final chapter, Chapter Four, we begin rethinking the ethical in terms of an interanimality that recognizes non-human animals as variants of the same sensible-sensing corporeality as humans. In contrast to the traditional hierarchical relation between the human and animal, we follow Merleau-Ponty in proposing a fleshly plane of immanence that becomes recognizable in our comingling and web-like intertwining with non-human others. We are them and they are us.

The Body of Sin: An Emergent Account of Sin as a Cosmic Power in Romans 5-8

Author: Croasmun, Matthew Daniel

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1539911770?accountid=14906

Abstract: Scholarship on Sin in Romans 5-8 is plagued by questions about how to understand the vivid personification Paul employs: Are we to conceive of Sin as a real, personal power that menaces the human agent, as a complex social system of human sins, or simply as a literary device that describes a feature of individual human agency? In Romans, Sin is at the very least each of these things. That is, it can appropriately be analyzed at either the individual, the social, or the mythological level. This is clear from "the text itself," and, to a degree, scholars of very different stripes agree about these basic features. The problem is that, while it is agreed that "sin" is described in Romans at each of these levels, no scholar is working with an ontology that permits all these conceptions of s/Sin to coexist. Instead, they find they must privilege one or the other as "reality" and relegate others to the realm of metaphor. Seeking, therefore, a trans-ordinal ontology--an ontology that can make sense of these different "levels" of analysis and their corresponding ontologies--in Chapter 2, I propose we turn to emergentism. In emergentism, we find a description of the world in terms of various "levels." Entities at higher levels emerge from entities at lower levels and yet also exercise "downward causation" back upon these lower-level entities, resulting in causal feedback loops. In Chapter 3, I turn specifically to an emergent account of personhood. On this account, the convoluted causal feedback loops that arise in organisms are what we can most readily describe as "selves," first at the organismic (biological) level and subsequently at the subjective (psychological) level. Biological descriptions of superorganisms and their collective intelligence, alongside sociological accounts of collective "epistemic subjects" and "corporate persons" yield an account of persons at larger scales and higher degrees of abstraction than that of individual persons. This level of emergence I call "mythological" and I propose that Sin be understood as a person emergent at the mythological level. Armed with an emergentist trans-ordinal ontology and a general account of mythological personhood, in Chapter 4 I return to Romans and offer a reading of the Pauline text that understands Sin, the cosmic power, as a person emergent from a complex system of human sins. On such a description, one can maintain at once that Sin enters the world through human transgression (Rom 5) and that, through this exercise of individual human agency, we become members of the superorganismic Body of Sin (Rom 6:6). Sin's constraint of the human agent (Rom 7)--the member of Sin's body--can then be understood as downward causation. This constraint comports with a liberationist phenomenology of the social coercion of Sin, described in terms of Mary Douglas's account of institutional regulation of individuals' moral psychologies. In Chapter 5, I consider that, on Paul's account, not only does Sin have a body, but, in fact, that body is sexed female. It is here that Sin gains the proper name, Hamartia. Hamartia conforms to some of the ancient stereotypes of female physiology--most notably, an enslavement to desire. But she also exercises paradigmatically masculine imperium. In order to understand the significance of Paul's description of Hamartia in these terms, I compare Hamartia to another ancient mythological imperial woman: the goddess Roma. The Body of Christ, I argue, functions as the masculine counterpart to the feminine Body of Sin. But Christ, too, both fulfills and subverts the expectations of the dominant ideology. I conclude Chapter 5 with a discussion of the ethical and theological significance of the multivalence of Paul's engagement with this dominant ideology. Finally, I conclude by outlining a trajectory for a constructive Christian hamartiological project born from this emergent account of Sin. I also describe how my readings of Sin and of Roma provide suggestions for how to understand various complex systems that shape our contemporary globalizing world, especially The Market.

The Epistemic Significance of Values in Science

Author: Holter, Brandon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1515780162?accountid=14906

Abstract: The proper role of values in science has been a hotly debated topic for many decades now. The traditional view of epistemic justification holds that scientific objectivity requires suppression of value judgments; theories are only justified by an impartial analysis of the evidence (Haack 1998; Pinnick, Koertge, and Almedar 2003). Traditionalists worry that values bias scientists, leading them to believe what they would like to be true regardless of the evidence. Proponents of value-laden science argue that the justification of scientific theories cannot be isolated from moral and practical judgments (Kuhn 1962; Longino 2002a). The arguments they advance purport to show that values are not merely biases, values can play a positive role in justifying beliefs. Underdetermination arguments claim that evidence alone cannot determine theory choice (Laudan 1990; Longino 1979; Quine 1951).These arguments do not motivate an epistemic role for values in science, however, because values may influence scientists' theoretical beliefs without justifying those beliefs. As a result, philosophers have advanced a number of new arguments for the epistemic necessity of values judgments. This dissertation examines several of these arguments with an eye toward their deficiencies in order to develop an account of values in scientific reasoning that does not legitimate bias or delusion, as the traditionalists fear. Drawing on both old and new arguments, I argue that values help determine when a theory is sufficiently justified by the evidence (Douglas 2000; Kitcher 2011a; Rudner 1953). While evidence alone provides justifying reasons for belief, scientists must decide how much evidence is needed to justify scientific claims. Different scientific inquiries require different epistemic standards and, I argue, traditional value-free epistemologies cannot account for this variation. Philosophers cannot explain why scientists in different contexts adopt different epistemic standards without appealing to value judgments. On the view I adopt, the evidence justifies a claim when we have good reasons to believe we can act on that claim; a theory is sufficiently justified in the epistemic sense when it is sufficiently justified for practical purposes. Allowing values to guide these decisions, I argue, does not allow values to displace rigorous attention to the evidence.

Clarissa's Suffering: Theorizing Sympathy and Physical Pain in the Eighteenth Century

Author: Hungerpiller, Audrey

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1541021193?accountid=14906

Abstract: This thesis examines theories of pain in the eighteenth century, and what it meant to sympathize with the pain of another. I begin briefly with the theories of Descartes and his adherents before focusing on David Hartley and John Locke. Physicians and natural philosophers of the period understood pain as a pure mechanism of the nervous system, confined to the tubelike fibers that run through the body. Naturally everyone feels pain by some means, whether illness or injury, so men ought to be able to sympathize with the afflictions of others. Yet, according to Adam Smith in The Theory of Moral Sentiments, this is not so. He argues for the ultimate inexpressibility of pain; our nerves do not mimic the activity of another's nerves, and our reality cannot completely intersect with the reality of another. If sympathy is a shared suffering, pain is impossible to share. Therefore, physical afflictions cannot receive others' sympathies in the same manner as those of the passions, which pass easily between minds. ! ! While the physicians separated the painful operations of the body from the passions and from mind, newly popular sentimental fiction attempted to reunite all three in their work as their authors strove to replicate realistic experiences, expressly fictional or otherwise. Bodily pain and emotional suffering lie on either end of a dialectic, and I propose that the fulcrum sits at inventive semantics that rely on a consciously-created mediator. To demonstrate this, I use the example of Samuel Richardson's Clarissa: or, History of a Young Lady. Richardson assiduously disallows his characters to express real physical pain directly, but frequently uses every linguistic variation of the word "pain" to emphasize emotional and motivational distress rather than bodily harm. Clarissa in particular refuses to say that she experiences any discomfort even when the situation suggests she ought, emphasizing the unimportance of physical substance to her being. Although Richardson's characters undergo all sorts of pains, physical and cognitive, noun and verb, the only ones directly accessible to the reader are the pains of the mind; all that is known of the body comes mediated several times over by the epistles, semantics, and Richardson himself. This essay suggests how novelists incorporate and accommodate these anatomical theories and their relation to the passions rather than repudiate them for the sake of a fabricated subjectivity.

Abstract: In this thesis, I will show why Bayesian learning models are inadequate for arguing against Noam Chomsky's Poverty of the Stimulus argument. Noam Chomsky claims that if humans did not have an innate, language-specific learning mechanism, they would not be able to demonstrate such a strong linguistic competence at such a young age, given the paucity of linguistic information they are exposed to in early years. The Bayesians attempt to respond to the Poverty of the Stimulus by offering an empirical model that would show how children are able to obtain linguistic competency given the limited linguistic input. However, I will show that the models offered by the Bayesians aren't possible models of human learners and as a result are not adequate responses to Chomsky's Poverty of the Stimulus argument.

Ecological realism, prediction, and a new understanding of perception

Author: Patton, Paul

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1562271433?accountid=14906

Abstract: The psychologist J. J. Gibson, and later the enactivists, espoused a view of perception emphasized active sensory exploration, and the biological functions perception serves. They tended to neglect the internal complexity of perceptual systems. Neuroscientists and computer vision researchers, on the other hand, focus on the complex structure and inner workings of perceptual systems, to the neglect of biological and behavioral context. Here I will formulate a version of ecological realism which reconciles and critiques these seemingly disparate approaches. I argue that the objects of perception are relational invariant structures preserved within the changing flux of perceptual input. The function of perception is to enable appropriate behavior with respect to affordances, which are objective three-way relations between worldly features, animal abilities, and animal needs. The invariant relationships perceived tend to be those which signify affordance relationships for the species and individual in question. The perception-action cycle is but one example of the circular dynamics of perceptual systems. The neural portions of such systems are also in a state of constant feed-forward and feedback dynamical interaction with one another. These dynamics confer an active autonomy on perceptual systems as manifested by phenomena like dreams, hallucinations, and perceptual illusions. Metaphorically, such systems may function to constantly formulate and test hypotheses about affordances based on perceptual evidence and prior categorical experience. Hierarchical predictive models of perception, in which perceptual systems consist of a hierarchy of Bayesian statistical predictors, represent a possible means by which this metaphor might be crafted into a testable scientific hypothesis. Perception, even if it involves actively autonomous perceptual systems coping with ambiguous input, is epistemically reliable most of the time, because it is constantly tested by action. Perceptual states are true or valid if they bear an appropriate relationship to objective affordance relationships, and false or invalid if they do not. These views require a reformulation of the venerable distinction between `direct' and `indirect' perception. Perception is ontologically direct in the sense of dealing in objective relationships in the world, but justificationally indirect in the sense of requiring an argument that perceptual beliefs are generally epistemically reliable.

The early modern debate on the problem of matter's divisibility: A Neo-Aristotelian solution

Author: Connors, Colin Edward

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1654778773?accountid=14906

Abstract: My dissertation focuses on the problem of matter's divisibility in the 17 th -18 th centuries. The problem of material divisibility is a focal point at which the metaphysical principle of simplicity and the mathematical principle of space's infinite divisibility conflict. The principle of simplicity is the metaphysical requirement that there must be a simple or indivisible being that is the constitutive foundation of all composite things in nature. Without simple beings, there cannot be composite beings. The mathematical principle of space's infinite divisibility is a staple of Euclidean geometry: space must be divisible into infinitely smaller parts because indivisibles or points cannot compose extension. Without reconciling these metaphysical and mathematical principles, one can call into question the integrity of mathematics and metaphysics. Metaphysical contradiction results from the application of metaphysical simplicity to the composition of material bodies that occupy infinitely divisible space. How can a simple being constitute a material object while occupying a space that lacks a smallest part? Should we assume that a composite material object (such as the paper in front of the reader) exists in an infinitely divisible space, then the simple beings must occupy a space that consists of ever smaller spaces. The simple being thereby appears to consist of parts simpler than itself--a metaphysical contradiction. Philosophers resolve this contradiction by either modifying the metaphysical principle of simplicity to allow for the occupation of infinitely divisible space, or have simply dismissed one principle for the sake of preserving the other principle. The rejection of one principle for preserving the other principle is an undesirable path. Philosophers would either forfeit any attempt to account for the composition of material reality by rejecting simplicity or deny understanding of geometry heretofore via the rejection of space's infinite divisibility. My objective in this dissertation is two-fold: 1.) to provide an historical analysis of various philosophers' attempts to reconcile simplicity and infinite divisibility or to argue for the exclusive nature of the said principles; 2.) to articulate a reconciliation between simplicity and infinite divisibility. Underlying both objectives is my attempt to draw a connection between the metaphysical principle of simplicity and the metaphysical principle of sufficient reason. Having shown in the historical section that each philosopher implicitly references a modified version of the principle of sufficient reason when articulating their theories of metaphysical simplicity, I will use this common principle to develop a Neo-Aristotelian solution to the problem of material divisibility. This Neo-Aristotelian solution differs from other accounts in the historical section by including a potential parts theory of material divisibility while modifying the principle of simplicity: simple beings are no longer conceived as constitutive parts of a material thing, but as the sources of unity for a natural composite being.

A critical assessment of partners in Christ Caring Ministry: A study at the fourth street Missionary Baptist Church

Author: Flakes, Johnny H., III

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1678078016?accountid=14906

Abstract: In 2002, Fourth Street Missionary Baptist Church in Columbus, GA, began an in-reach ministry called Partners in Christ Caring Ministry (PICCM). This study was designed to determine whether participation in the Partners In Christ Caring Ministry (PICCM) is due to intrinsic, altruistic behavior or whether participation is a result of extrinsic non-altruistic behavior, and whether these behaviors impacted the increase or decline in participation by the congregation in PICCM. The study design included data collected from PICCM members' altruistic behaviors and information regarding the obstacles that impeded members from participating in PICCM. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected to analyze altruistic behavior of individual PICCM members regarding participation. The methodology of the study includes descriptions of participants, ethical considerations. Members of the congregation were invited to be participants in the study. Approximately 200 PICCM members were presented with The Self-Report Altruism Scale. On The Self-Report Altruism Scale, PICCM respondents used a Likert Scale from 1-5 and selected the number that corresponded with the answer that most accurately described how often a particular altruistic behavior was demonstrated. Data were entered in SPSS software. Inferential and descriptive statistics were used to analyze the three research questions. An ANOVA was used to analyze all three research questions regarding the relationship between altruistic behaviors of PICCM members who have high participation in attending PICCM meetings versus PICCM members who have low participation in PICCM. The research failed to reject Null Hypothesis 1 with the exception of two altruistic behaviors regarding helping carry a stranger's belongs. The research failed to reject Null Hypothesis 2 and 3, indicating that there was no significant difference in altruistic behaviors between PICCM members with high participation and PICCM members with low participation. The growth and development of PICCM will be contingent upon the pastor's recommendations based on the fmdings of the research and effectively communicating these recommendations to the leaders of the PICCM ministry.

Mechanical epistemology and mixed mathematics: Descartes's Problems and Hobbes's Unity

Author: Adams, Marcus P.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1609201848?accountid=14906

Abstract: My dissertation answers what appears to be a simple question: How is Hobbes's politics related to his physics and metaphysics? However, answering this question has proved more difficult for scholars than it appears at first glance, and there has there has been no consensus in the literature over the past fifty years. Two well-represented extremes dominate the literature: the first view claims that Hobbes's politics is deduced from his physics and ultimately his metaphysics; and the second view claims that the politics arose independently of Hobbes's other work. My dissertation argues that Hobbes does in fact provide a unified systematic philosophy, and I contrast this unity with problems in Descartes's epistemology and optics. To make this argument, I carve a middle way between the two extremes in the literature by situating Hobbes within mechanical philosophy and 17th century mathematics. I use three concepts to clarify Hobbes's project: mechanical explanation, maker's knowledge, and mixed mathematical science. First, I show that for Hobbes a mechanical explanation involves tracing the motions of bodies at various levels of complexity, from simple points in geometry to human bodies in the state of nature and to commonwealth bodies. This view provides Hobbes with resources for a naturalized epistemology, which I show is the point at issue in Hobbes's Objections to Descartes's Meditations . Second, Hobbes says that we have "maker's knowledge" in geometry and politics. I show that "maker's knowledge" is Hobbes's empiricist answer to (1) how we have causal knowledge in politics and mathematics by constructing and (2) how mathematics is applicable to the world. Finally, I show that the mixed mathematical sciences, e.g., optics, were Hobbes's inspiration for a unified philosophical system. I argue that the physics in De corpore , the optics in De homine , and the politics in Leviathan are treated by Hobbes as mixed mathematical sciences, which provides a new way to see Hobbes as a consistent and non-reductive naturalist. Viewed in this light, the Leviathan turns out to have more methodological similarities to optics than to geometry.

The causal structure of evolutionary theory

Author: Otsuka, Jun

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1560892511?accountid=14906

Abstract: Modern evolutionary genetics studies evolution as a population-level statistical trend, abstracting away concrete causal interactions among individual organisms. Crucial to this approach are various mathematical formulae, which have formed the core part of evolutionary theory since the Modern Synthesis. The abstract nature of the evolutionary principles, however, has invoked a philosophical skepticism with respect to their causal basis: do they describe causal mechanisms or just phenomenological patterns? The goal of this thesis is to identify and extend the causal foundations of evolutionary models using causal graph theory. It first derives the standard evolutionary formulae, such as the breeder's equation and Lande's equation, from causal models representing selection and reproduction. The explicit definition of the underlying causal structures establishes adaptive evolution as a bona fide causal process, where selection and fitness are both causes of evolutionary response. The second part extends this result in order to address complex evolutionary phenomena not covered by the standard models, such as development (which is defined as inter-phenotypic causal networks), epigenetic inheritance, and niche construction. The extensions will be accomplished by way of introducing formal methods to discover causal relationships from observational data, as well as deriving new mathematical formulae that incorporate the identified causal pathways into the prediction of evolutionary response. Through these analyses the present thesis proposes a unifying framework that systematically translates any form of "proximate" causal assumptions into "ultimate" evolutionary dynamics. The final chapter gives a formal characterization of this new framework and explores its implications for the study of evolution.

Realistic Priests: Same-gender marriage conflict, the Realm of God, and clergy leadership

Author: Massey, Samuel R. D.

Abstract: This dissertation examined clergy leadership in the midst of the Iowa and Presbyterian Church (USA) conflict over same-gender marriage. Reflective of Presbyterian Church (USA) and other literature, the presumption was that clergy embrace conflict as part of a priestly role that encourages realm of God values of diversity, inclusion, and reconciliation. Clergy experience routine conflict, and often it can be destructive. Clergy exercise power in words and other symbols in order to fulfill the priestly role. To explore the clergy use of power as priests, discourse analysis of interviews with them was conducted. Documents submitted by clergy were also submitted to discourse analysis, as were the physical arrangements in which clergy function. Leadership theory, positioning theory, and a philosophy-physics termed agential realism provided the underlying theoretical foundation for the dissertation. Among the conclusions were the verification of clergy dislike of conflict and neglect of the denominational vision of the realm of God; the effectiveness of positioning theory's positioning diamond as an analytical tool; and the need to rethink theological education in light of first, the clergy calling to priestly service in ubiquitous conflict, and second, clergy success being measured in light of Jesus' prioritization of the realm of God over church institutional concerns.

Some alternatives to model selection and new approaches to computing for economics

Author: Giannakouros, Panayotis

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1650643367?accountid=14906

Abstract: This interdisciplinary dissertation in statistics, economics, and social science methodology derives a methodological approach for economics from philosophical principles, identifies barriers to its adoption, and presents tools and methods for overcoming those barriers. It addresses aspects of inquiry often treated in the discipline of statistics. The dissertation takes a process philosophy approach encompassing aspects of classical pragmatism and documents the influence of this problem solving philosophy on Original Institutionalism and its support for a link between Post Keynesian economics and Original Institutionalism. Contributions are motivated through two case studies. The statistical methods used for policy persuasion in the first case study, in community economics, contrast with the econometric approach and its philosophical and theoretical foundations. The second case study, a contribution to modern statistical theory focusing on alternatives to model selection, reveals the importance of computational thinking and the institutional adjustments the discipline of statistics carried out in embracing that. The dissertation compares and contrasts a ceremonial and instrumental role of mathematical rhetoric in the history of economic thought and methodology and closes with a Moore Method inspired course as a practical start for revising the economics curriculum to reclaim the Keynesian-Institutionalist tradition addressing emerging needs in the discipline as a whole and to train students in the instrumental methodological approach here derived.

Duhem's balancing act: Quasi-static reasoning in physical theory

Author: Dupree, Meghan Danielle

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1609201632?accountid=14906

Abstract: The celebrated philosopher-physicist Pierre Duhem appears to maintain virtually contradictory views. On the one hand, he claims that science does not aim to explain natural phenomena, where he assumes that an "explanation" strives to reveal the natural world underpinnings hiding "behind the veil" of observable phenomena. Despite these strong disavowals, he also insists that successful scientific theories should converge on "natural classifications" which allegedly provide "hints concerning the true affinities of things." But won't such relationships also lie "behind the veil"? These warring inclinations have created significant exegetical confusions, leading his interpreters to classify him as an antirealist, a realist and everything else in between. Duhem is clearly trying to get across some important methodological lesson about science. But what is it? The trick is to align his philosophy more closely with the forms of physics he endorses. On this basis, I argue that Duhem's disavowals of "explanation" actually represent arguments against a dynamic laws picture of science: the doctrine that science must seek laws that track material systems according to the basic patterns of D-N explanation. He argues that many of natures most important hidden quantities (e.g., entropy and potential energy) were not discovered in a dynamical manner but were instead uncovered by stringing together relationships in the quasi-static manner employed in thermodynamics. Indeed, it is the deep relationships of the latter subject of the latter subject that supply paradigms of the "natural classifications" that Duhem seeks. Once one follows through the details of his recommendations, employing concrete scientific examples, one realizes that Duhem's reflections on the scientific method greatly enlarge our appreciation of what the many varieties of "good science" can look like. This challenges many dogmatic presumptions about the scientific methodology that still prevail in contemporary philosophy of science.

Experiment and bias: The case of parsimony in comparative cognition

Author: Meketa, Irina G.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1548008815?accountid=14906

Abstract: Comparative cognition is the interdisciplinary field of animal cognition and behavior studies, which includes comparative psychology and branches of ethology, biology, and neuroscience. My dissertation shows that the quasi-epistemic value of parsimony plays a problematic role in the experimental setting of comparative cognition. More specifically, I argue that an idiosyncratic interpretation of the statistical hypothesis-testing method, known as the Neyman-Pearson Method (NPM), embeds an Occamist parsimony preference into experimental methodology in comparative cognition, which results in an underattribution bias, or a bias in favor of allegedly simple cognitive ontologies. I trace this parsimony preference to the content of the null hypothesis within the NPM, and defend a strategy for modifying the NPM to guard against the underattribution bias. I recommend adopting an evidence-driven strategy for choosing the null hypothesis. Further, I suggest a role for non-empirical values, such as ethical concerns, in the weighting of Type I and Type II error-rates. I contend that statistical models are deeply embedded in experimental practice and are not value-free. These models provide an often overlooked door through which values, both epistemic and non-epistemic, can enter scientific research. Since statistical models generally, and the NPM in particular, play a role in a wide variety of scientific disciplines, this dissertation can also be seen as a case study illustrating the importance of attending to the choice a particular statistical model. This conclusion suggests that various philosophical investigations of scientific practice--from inquiry into the nature of scientific evidence to analysis of the role of values in science--would be greatly enriched by increased attention to experimental methodology, including the choice and interpretation of statistical models.

Interventionist causation in physical science

Author: Zwier, Karen R.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1667406238?accountid=14906

Abstract: The current consensus view of causation in physics, as commonly held by scientists and philosophers, has several serious problems. It fails to provide an epistemology for the causal knowledge that it claims physics to possess; it is inapplicable in a prominent area of physics (classical thermodynamics); and it is difficult to reconcile with our everyday use of causal concepts and claims. In this dissertation, I use historical examples and philosophical arguments to show that the interventionist account of causation constitutes a promising alternative for a "physically respectable" account of causation. The interventionist account explicates important parts of the experimental practice of physics and important aspects of the ways in which physical theory is used and applied. Moreover, the interventionist account succeeds where the consensus view of causation in physics fails. I argue that the interventionist account provides an epistemology of causal knowledge in physics that is rooted in experiment. On the interventionist view, there is a close link between experiment and the testing of causal claims. I give several examples of experiments from the early history of thermodynamics that scientists used in interventionist-type arguments. I also argue that interventionist claims made in the context of a physical theory can be epistemically justified by reference to the experimental interventions and observations that serve as evidence for the theory. I then show that the interventionist account of causation is well-suited to the patterns of reasoning that are intrinsic to thermodynamic theory. I argue that interventionist reasoning constitutes the structural foundation of thermodynamic theory, and that thermodynamic theory can provide clear answers to meaningful questions about whether or not a certain variable is a cause of another in a given context. Finally, I argue that the interventionist account offers the prospect of a unification of "physically respectable" causation and our everyday notion of causation. I conclude the dissertation by sketching an anti-foundationalist unification of causation, according to which causal reasoning occurs in the same manner in physics as it does in other branches of life and scientific research.

Epistemological implications of representational pluralism

Author: Harmon, Ian Thomas

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1652004277?accountid=14906

Abstract: In this dissertation I argue that the framework under which epistemology operates should be broadened to account for developments in cognitive science that indicate that a good deal of cognition and reasoning involves the use of non-linguistic representations. In chapter 1, I argue that, although epistemology is the theory of knowledge, epistemologists generally operate as though their field is simply the theory of propositional knowledge. Epistemologists generally assume that knowledge is a certain type of belief relation to a true proposition. However, cognitive science indicates that many of our mental representations are not belief-like at all, and thereby, not belief relations to propositions. Rather, the mind employs representations that take the form of images, scale models, activation patterns, and so on. I call this claim representational pluralism. If some of these non-linguistic representations are constitutive of knowledge, as I argue that they are in later chapters, then this requires a substantial revision of the traditional epistemological framework. I proceed to introduce some potential consequences of departing from the propositional knowledge tradition in epistemology. These consequences pertain most directly to two issues, namely, philosophical methodology and our understanding of normative standards of rationality. In chapter 2 I discuss knowledge-how, a type of knowledge that many have argued is non-propositional. In the first part of the chapter I discuss two intellectualist positions, that is, positions that hold that know-how is propositional. Stanley and Williamson argue that propositional knowledge is both necessary and sufficient for know-how, while Bengson and Moffett argue that propositional knowledge is not sufficient, but is necessary, for know-how. In chapter 3 I argue that epistemology's failure to take representational pluralism seriously has skewed the field's understanding of normative standards of rationality. I discuss two ways in which epistemology's normative standards of rationality are limited. First, they apply only to agents with purely linguistic or belief-like cognitive systems. Second, they apply only to cognitive systems that are capable of meeting them, due to what I call the ought-can principle. In chapter 4, I examine the role that knowledge plays in two domains: everyday life and the institution of science. In everyday contexts, I argue that knowledge plays a warrant-granting role for action. This way of thinking about knowledge has drawn some attention in the epistemology literature from Keith DeRose, Jason Stanley, John Hawthorne, and Jeremy Fantl and Matthew McGrath, amongst others. However, I argue that none of these "pragmatic encroachment" approaches draw the correct connection between knowledge and practical affairs. In particular, many of these accounts are designed to be supplements to more traditional, independent accounts of knowledge. In chapter 5, I present summaries of the preceding chapters. I then conclude that epistemology, in order to be the theory of knowledge, rather than the theory of propositional knowledge, must become more pluralistic. This is not to say that we need to abandon studies of propositional knowledge. But rather, epistemology as a field should become more fragmented, specialized, and connected to scientific accounts of the mind and cognition. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

Although this theory was developed in the context of GMM trials, it can apply to other endeavors, research or not, where whole communities might be affected. As GMM make their way from laboratories to villages of developing countries to test their effectiveness in controlling vector-borne diseases, community authorization emerges as a critical and urgent, yet undefined, mechanism of protection and respect for communities who might be affected by research and its outcomes. Following a constructivist Grounded Theory approach, I analyzed three prominent GMM trials from Mexico, the Cayman Islands, and Malaysia. Nineteen (19) interviews and two hundred and forty nine (249) documents were analyzed in order to uncover the substantive and procedural aspects of authentic and sufficient community authorization for research, as well as the factors that affect such authorization. This interdisciplinary bioethics thesis supports a relational notion of community authorization, as a continuous state of ongoing, maintenance-dependent, approval for research from inception through all stages. Enabled by successful relationships between researchers and community groups and individuals, this state manifests in formal and informal ways at all levels of the community; institutional, national, regional, local, and even individual, and involves authorities, both official and traditional, and publics alike. The state of authorization manifests in reciprocity, or the fulfillment of commitment to promote mutual interests. The findings challenge current conceptions of research participants as well as consent, and consequently current practices of research appraisal. Future research is needed to provide researchers, research ethics boards, and regulatory agencies with standardized tools to gauge the conduct of research in relationship to the community. The elements of this theory, as well as its reliability, applicability and generalizability, need to be tested and refined in future empirical work in multiple contexts and different fields.

Searching for a criminological compass: A reappraisal of theory and development of a Parmenidean Model of Criminology

Author: Degarmo, Matthew

Abstract: Criminology has enfolded a number of outliers into its paradigm(s) over the past 100 years. Most momentous was absorption of the mathematical form through the wide-spread adoption of statistics that had been developed throughout the 19th Century. While the infusion of statistics has resulted in an expansive growth of knowledge and solidified the criminologist's place within academia, it has led to a muddling of theory. Most detrimental, application of the mathematical form led to the binary treatment of theory that resultantly led to the segregation of theory, both in regards to the separation of theories from one another and the expulsion and isolation of theoretical bodies from normative criminology, in general. Currently all historical and contemporary criminological theory is housed within either one of two mutually exclusive paradigmatic spheres as argued by Ruth Kornhauser (1978): "social-disorganization" theory/paradigm, which encapsulates control and strain theories, or "cultural-deviance" theory/paradigm, which encapsulates all cultural theories. These disparate paradigms are distinguished by various competing underlying assumptions that cannot be merged (1978; Hirschi, 1979), thereby they represent binary opposites of one another. It will be argued that this eventually led to criminological theory either being "right" or "wrong" and if it is one, it cannot be the other. Acting as a sort of "outlier machine," this has led to the effective cleaving from the field of criminology a number of "wrong" conceptualizations/theories. Because of the binary treatment of theory, large amounts of information are effectively cleaved from a field's paradigmatic sphere and thereby become "outliers". Criminological outliers are essentially a result of picking and choosing "right" theory while simultaneously displacing "wrong" theory. To cure this dilemma a theoretical model should be developed. The end result of this dissertation is to rebuild the theoretical machine of criminology, thereby constructing a unified theoretical model of criminological theory capable of withstanding the inclusion of outliers and thereby bridging criminology's two competing paradigms. The model that will be constructed to repair the outlier machine assumes that the use of binary, such as the distinction between competing assumptions undergirding the criminological paradigm, is both inappropriate and injurious.

Ecology and evolutionary biology: On the diversity and relationality of stability and dynamical concepts

Author: Friesen, Stephen Mark

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1648654656?accountid=14906

Abstract: This study articulates a novel conception of the relation between ecology and evolutionary biology, for service in the relatively new field of the philosophy of ecology and the philosophy of biology more broadly. I develop a relational thesis in which ecology and evolutionary biology are understood as mutually demarcating, since they emerge from transpositional patterns of relations amidst a shared constellation of fundamental concepts of stability and change. This proposal is derived from a consideration of two research avenues in the philosophy of biology. The first concerns the relatively young field of the philosophy of ecology, and in particular the attempts by some of its principal investigators to give a general account of the science. The second research context concerns the philosophy of biology more generally, and the acknowledged need for a better understanding of the relationship between ecology and evolutionary biology. The relational thesis is derived from insights obtained through a comparative analysis of certain key aspects of ecology and evolutionary biology. These key contexts include a reexamination of Charles Darwin's conception of the struggle for existence and its relation to natural selection, Stephen Forbes progenitorial researches in limnology and community ecology, the development of the concept of competitive exclusion both in the care of G. F. Gause and David Lack, and core mathematical models in ecology and evolutionary biology.

The Soft Megamachine: Lewis Mumford's Metaphor of Technological Society and Implications for (participatory) Technology Assessment

Author: Gano, Gretchen

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1640934302?accountid=14906

Abstract: This dissertation explores the megamachine, a prominent metaphor in American humanist and philosopher of technology, Lewis Mumford's Myth of the Machine series. The term refers critically to dynamic, regimented human capacities that drive scientific and technical innovation in society. Mumford's view of the nature of collectives focuses on qualities and patterns that emerge from the behavior of groups, societies, systems, and ecologies. It is my aim to reenergize key concepts about collective capacities drawn from Lewis Mumford's critique of historical and modern sociotechnical arrangements. I investigate the possibility of accessing those capacities through improved design for Technology Assessment (TA), formal practices that engage experts and lay citizens in the evaluation of complex scientific and technical issues. I analyze the components of Mumford's megamachine and align key concerns in two pivotal works that characterize the impact of collective capacities on society: Bruno Latour's Pasteurization of France (1988) and Elias Canetti's Crowds and Power (1962). As I create a model of collective capacities in the sociotechnical according to the parameters of Mumford's megamachine, I rehabilitate two established ideas about the behavior of crowds and about the undue influence of technological systems on human behavior. I depart from Mumford's tactics and those of Canetti and Latour and propose a novel focus for STS on "sociotechnical crowds" as a meaningful unit of social measure. I make clear that Mumford's critique of the sociotechnical status quo still informs the conditions for innovation today. Using mixed mode qualitative methods in two types of empirical field studies, I then investigate how a focus on the characteristics and components of collective human capacities in sociotechnical systems can affect the design and performance of TA. I propose a new model of TA, Emergent Technology Assessment (ETA), which includes greater public participation and recognizes the interrelationship among experience, affect and the material in mediating the innovation process. The resulting model -- the "soft" megamachine --introduces new strategies to build capacity for responsible innovation in society.

Hacking Science: Emerging Parascientific Genres and Public Participation in Scientific Research

Author: Kelly, Ashley Rose

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1554326900?accountid=14906

Abstract: The Internet, in Brian Trench's (2008) words, "is turning science communication inside-out" and, as a result, the boundaries between internal and external science communication are "eroding." Yet these boundaries have long been complicated by "para-scientific genres" such as trade magazines, as Sarah Kaplan and Joanna Radin (2011) show, when they detail genres that exist "alongside" mainstream scientific genres. These genres' existence is dependent upon their association with established scientific media and genres, such as the scholarly journal and the scientific research article. Moreover, these genres reach a wider audience, including policymakers and others involved in the community, with a mission of influencing the direction of a discipline or field. Bringing together these ideas, Carolyn R. Miller and I (forthcoming) extend the notion of parascientific genres to account for emerging genres of science communication online, suggesting that the rhetorical work parascientific genres do has been partially moved into more public (or, external) spheres of scientific discourse. This dissertation focuses on the erosion of boundaries between internal and external science communication to explore the possibilities for parascientific genres--and looks specifically to citizen science as a site of inquiry. While some attention has been paid to citizen science, it is often devoted to scientist-driven cases, where discursive acts are governed by rhetorics of professionalized science. Participant-driven citizen science can depart from these conventions, I maintain. And interesting examples of parascientific genres, or genres that demonstrate characteristics of both internal and external science communication, are available for examination. In this study, I trace the history of this distinction between expert and public science communication, looking back to early scientists, amateur scientists, and forward to the emerging trends in citizen science. I also uncover an emerging sphere, both within and beyond citizen science, where hackers have become involved in scientific research. I trace this phenomenon to the emergence of "hackerspaces." I then take up Safecast as a case study to suggest that boundaries between expert and public spheres of science communication are eroding. Securing funding and support for Safecast's work--collecting radiation readings--relied on the use of "parascientific genres." I suggest that emerging "parascientific" genres--genres alongside traditional scientific genres--demonstrate features characteristic of both expert and public scientific communication. To better understand this phenomenon, I employ rhetorical genre theory and stylistic analysis in a comparative analysis. I compare traditional scientific genres (grant proposals, conference talks, and scientific databases) to what I believe are parascientific genres. The parascientific genres I analyze are science-focused Kickstarter funding proposals, conference talks, and Safecast's database. This study helps to address questions about the relationship between expert and public science communication as well as professional and amateur communication of scientific and technical subject matter.

Three Perspectives on Multilevel Selection: An Experimental, Historical, and Synthetic Analysis of Group-Level Selection

Author: Dimond, Christopher C.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1640906470?accountid=14906

Abstract: During the 1960s, the long-standing idea that traits or behaviors could be explained by natural selection acting on traits that persisted "for the good of the group" prompted a series of debates about group-level selection and the effectiveness with which natural selection could act at or across multiple levels of biological organization. For some this topic remains contentious, while others consider the debate settled, even while disagreeing about when and how resolution occurred, raising the question: "Why have these debates continued?" Here I explore the biology, history, and philosophy of the possibility of natural selection operating at levels of biological organization other than the organism by focusing on debates about group-level selection that have occurred since the 1960s. In particular, I use experimental, historical, and synthetic methods to review how the debates have changed, and whether different uses of the same words and concepts can lead to different interpretations of the same experimental data. I begin with the results of a group-selection experiment I conducted using the parasitoid wasp Nasonia, and discuss how the interpretation depends on how one conceives of and defines a "group." Then I review the history of the group selection controversy and argue that this history is best interpreted as multiple, interrelated debates rather than a single continuous debate. Furthermore, I show how the aspects of these debates that have changed the most are related to theoretical content and empirical data, while disputes related to methods remain largely unchanged. Synthesizing this material, I distinguish four different "approaches" to the study of multilevel selection based on the questions and methods used by researchers, and I use the results of the Nasonia experiment to discuss how each approach can lead to different interpretations of the same experimental data. I argue that this realization can help to explain why debates about group and multilevel selection have persisted for nearly sixty years. Finally, the conclusions of this dissertation apply beyond evolutionary biology by providing an illustration of how key concepts can change over time, and how failing to appreciate this fact can lead to ongoing controversy within a scientific field.

The Silver Lining of Literature and Science: Spectral Reflections of Philosophy-Physics in Nineteenth-Century British Epistolary Novels

Author: Farrar, Aileen Miyuki

Abstract: This dissertation responds to the belligerence, hesitance, indifference, and wonder that has intensified over the last three decades towards the interdisciplinary study of literature and science. Since the nineteenth century, spectral metaphors have given shape to narratives of interdisciplinary tension, informing a history worried by horror stories of Cartesian mechanization, posthuman disembodiment, and academic hostilities. In answer, this dissertation engages the feminist technoscience and posthuman feminist theories of interdisciplinary scholars, including Gillian Beer, George Levine, and N. Katherine Hayles, and re-examines the narratives and metaphors of nineteenth-century Britain which consummate readings of mechanism and meaning. The goal is not to encourage reiterations of the ghost as a figure of interrupted disciplines, as others have established, but to re-examine the specter as an interstitial structure constellating the many speculative associations that welcome bold explorations between science and literature. Thus this dissertation reappropriates the specter as a harbinger of propitious interdisciplinarity. To this end, my arguments locate the philosophy-physics of Newtonian, entropic, and chaotic science in the diegetic margins of subjective experience in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818), Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights (1847), and Henry James's The Turn of the Screw (1898). In addition to the hybrid structure of the epistolary novel, I examine the spectrality (e.g. monstrosity, elusiveness, promise, and desire) of metaphors, including those of multiformed bodies, light, absence, and reflections. In this way, this dissertation pursues the épistèmic changes from matter- and motion- to energy- and information-based ontoepistemologies and traces an evolution of the nineteenth-century epistolary novel in its advancement alongside the sciences as both begin to comprehend a more indeterminate and probabilistic universe, simultaneously immense, vacuous, and wondrous beyond the rigidity of mimetic narrative. These analyses find meaning in human narrative as part of that nature which, like science, art seeks to understand and, in the end, reconnect nineteenth-century British literature not just with the scientific discourses of the period but with the increasingly technoscientific and ecocritical culture of the twenty-first century.

On the way to human communication: Principles of communication existence

Author: Matsuoka, Hirofumi

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1651051094?accountid=14906

Abstract: The present study advanced a general theory and a holistic model of human communication. The theory was not of using communication as a frame to interpret arbitrarily introduced issues of education, business, intercultural relationship, etc., but of modeling what basic elements communication consists of. The theory was intended to be a grand theory, where particularities of people's communication experience were seen as instances of what the theory indicates. To this end, the nature of mind and reality was identified as subsumptive motility through Jacques Lacan's theory of mind, Immanuel Kant's theory of cognition, and T'ien-T'ai Zhi-yi's [Special characters omitted] Threefold Truth [Special characters omitted]. Derived from the mind/reality nature was the general theory of human communication as the activation of change in its preservation . Having the general theory as a superclass, its instrumental subclass was deduced as the special theory of human communication defined as the process of building and belonging to the same abstract space with the other(s) . By taking together the general theory and special theory, a holistic model of human communication was developed, in which an interpenetrating relation between interpersonal and organizational communication was revealed. The question of what such basic concepts as mind, reality, language, self and other, culture, and norm, all mean and relate seamlessly to one another were also addressed along the way.

Investigating the psychological foundations of moral judgment

Author: Saunders, Katharine

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1524725245?accountid=14906

Abstract: Is there an early developing neuro-cognitive structure that is specific to our moral sense? Recent research has begun to explore this question using a classic thought experiment known as the trolley problem. These "trolley studies" have uncovered what appears to be a universal pattern of moral intuitions in adults that some argue can only be explained by assuming implicit knowledge of complex moral principles. In this dissertation, I build on this work by testing preschoolers' and adults' tacit knowledge of the principle of double effect - a principle that has a long history within the fields of philosophy, religion, and law, and which has recently been proposed to underlie our moral intuitions in the trolley problem. I also investigate the role of perceived ingroup/outgroup structure in moral judgment - a factor which others have hypothesized to be a foundation of moral judgment. Across three studies, preschoolers (studies 1 and 2) and adults (study 3) were tested on a series of dilemmas that were similar in structure to the traditional trolley problems, but involved property violations and assault (i.e. the apprehension of bodily harm) rather than "personal" violations such as battery or homicide. In all three studies, participants showed a strong and stable pattern of intuitions consistent with the principle of double effect: dilemmas in which an individual was harmed as a foreseen side effect of saving five people were judged favorably, but dilemmas in which an individual was intentionally harmed as a means to saving five people were judged unfavorably. Four-year-olds and adults (but not three-year-olds) also disapproved of scenarios in which an agent knowingly allowed a preventable harm to occur. Manipulations of minimal ingroup/outgroup structure had little to no effect on either preschoolers' or adults' moral judgments in these dilemmas. Implications for the structure and development of moral judgment are discussed.

Ideal-typology

Author: Gorrie, Colin Fraser

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1560892326?accountid=14906

Abstract: The critical aim of this dissertation is to show the lack of explanatory value of typological generalizations in generative research paradigms, and the constructive aim is to propose an alternative conception of typology which gives a justifiable place to typological facts. My contention is that we cannot conclude that the human language faculty (HLF) lacks the means to generate a linguistic phenomenon from only the lack of such a phenomenon in the languages of the world. The temptation to do so arises from equivocation regarding the term Language as used within different generative paradigms: the classical generative paradigm, and the generative-parametric paradigm. The former characterizes Language, understood as HLF, the mental object which allows us to produce and understand languages. For the latter, however, Language also includes the distribution of linguistic structures in the world. HLF is a natural kind; the distribution of linguistic structures in the world is not. Equivocation of the term 'Language' occurs when one notion is exchanged for the other within an argument. The problem: only natural kinds support induction. The goal of characterizing HLF is discovering what is necessarily true of HLF. The distribution of linguistic phenomena in the world, although constrained by what HLF allows us to acquire, is also constrained by historical contingency. Generalizations based on these accidental factors are valueless in characterizing HLF: I show this in two case studies, which deal with syllable structure and verbal morpheme order. I argue that the study of the distribution of linguistic phenomena in the world is a historical science, which requires a different set of assumptions than an experimental science such as the classical generative paradigm. The alternative I offer is called ideal-typology. Ideal-typology replaces inductive inference based on natural kinds with pragmatic explanation based on "ideal-types". Ideal-types are convenient fictions, purpose-built to manipulate our cognitive systems into understanding the diversity of historical-scientific data. I illustrate the practice of ideal-typology by showing how the diversity of Chinese tone systems can be measured and organized by the use of ideal-types. Beyond increasing understanding of the data themselves, ideal-typology yields hypotheses that experimental sciences can test.

Interpreting and clarifying Quine's indeterminacy thesis

Author: Allen, Heath

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1626750905?accountid=14906

Abstract: Since the publication of Word & Object in 1960, Quine's indeterminacy thesis has been a subject of great debate. This debate has generated many confusions and misinterpretations of what Quine was actually arguing. In this work, I attempt to provide an interpretation of the indeterminacy thesis based primarily on a close reading of the first two chapters of Word & Object . Then, I show how this interpretation can be used to dissolve some common confusions and objections to Quine's thesis.

Concerning the unity of knowledge and the aim of scientific inquiry: A critique of E.O. Wilson's consilience worldview

Author: Marcous, Carmen Maria

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1618961702?accountid=14906

Abstract: In this paper I set out to problematize what the distinguished evolutionary biologist, Edward O. Wilson, has presented to a popular audience as his consilience worldview. Wilson's consilience worldview is a metaphysical framework that presumes the existence of an underlying unity in the knowledge gleaned from otherwise diverse modes of intellectual inquiry, and details a particular normative approach for its discovery by scientists. After introducing Wilson's consilience worldview (WCW), I review philosophical and historical literature on the role that values play in scientific inquiry and explain how to understand WCW as a problematic bundle of prescriptive claims concerning the appropriate doing of scientific inquiry. Specifically, I examine deleterious implications for the study of human social behavior that result from attempted application of WCW in order to challenge Wilson's claim that WCW is the most profitable or promising research program to adopt in the study of human social behavior (what I describe as the `The Fertility Objection'). Then, I present an argument for why readers of Consilience should regard its central thesis, WCW, skeptically, as potentially deleterious to the process and aims of science (what I describe as the `The Scientific Integrity Objection').

The role of target systems in scientific practice

Author: Elliott-Graves, Alkistis

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1613205524?accountid=14906

Abstract: Scientists often construct simplified and idealized models in order to study complex phenomena. Yet they do not model a phenomenon in its entirety but target only the aspects of the phenomenon which they consider relevant. Hence, the model is said to describe the target system and not the whole phenomenon. The term `target system' has become popular in the philosophy of science, yet most authors do not provide a definition or analysis of the concept. The result is that the term is used ambiguously, which has undermined its potential value and usefulness for scientific practice. The aim of this dissertation is to provide a cogent account of target systems and their importance in science, with examples taken from case studies in ecology. The central issue I explore in my dissertation concerns the nature of target systems. What are target systems? How are they specified? How can they be evaluated? In my dissertation I give an account of target systems as real parts of systems in the world, which are specified through a process of partitioning and abstraction. I also provide a tentative theory of target system evaluation based on the notion of aptness for a particular scientific purpose. A deep understanding of nature and function of targets can resolve problems in science. I use the term `target system analysis', to denote the specification of target systems of one enquiry and the comparison of targets across enquiries. The last part of the dissertation is devoted to the application of the theory of target system specification and evaluation to a case study from actual scientific practice, invasion biology. Target system reveals that a scientist constructing a unificatory framework in invasion biology faces a tradeoff between generality and predictability. A truly unified framework must incorporate a multitude of different causes of invasion, yet the causes of each invasion are unique. Hence, invasion biology can have a unified theory, based on the process of invasion, yet this theory will be of little use to predicting particular invasions.

Truth or Dare: Management Theory at a Crossroads

Author: Fung, Ray

Abstract: This dissertation examines the state of management theory, whether as espoused by the (largely self-proclaimed) gurus, or by management academics. Given that philosophers of science have determined that theory is supposed to provide reliable, non-obvious predictions I test whether management theory meets those requirements. I examine certain famous guru works for reliability through a case-study method. I examine the published results of management academia through a statistical analysis. I examine the non-obviousness of published management academia's hypotheses through a series of interviews and by posing a survey of those hypotheses to volunteers untrained in management knowledge to determine whether they find those predictions to be obvious. Management theory is currently found to be wanting. However, I then propose a set of prescriptions that might allow management to become a truly progressive discipline as well as what management academics and gurus could fruitfully deliver to audiences today

The pessimistic induction and the epistemic status of scientific theories

Author: Ozturk, Burkay T.

Abstract: Virtually all prominent critics of the Pessimistic Induction have so far assumed that in order to defeat the argument, one must show that there is a degree of continuity in the history of science at the level of theory. In my dissertation I challenge this assumption and argue for three theses: (I) The assumption in question can lend support to at best a very impoverished form of optimism about only bits and pieces of our best scientific theories is warranted. (II) A more promising strategy is possible: The Pessimistic Induction can be defeated if we can show that the evidence today's scientific community has for our best theories is qualitatively and quantitatively superior to the evidence past scientists had for their best theories. (III) The evidence today's scientific community has for some of our best theories (such as the Fermi-Landau Liquid theory) is unequivocally better than its historical predecessors, while there is no observable unequivocal improvement as far as the evidence we have for the theories in behavioral and medical sciences is concerned.

Demarcating Science: Philosophical Perspectives of Scientific Inquiry

Author: Hintiryan, Siroun

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1614529724?accountid=14906

Abstract: Throughout history, there has been an ongoing debate concerning which theories and practices should, in principle, be identified as science as opposed to being demarcated as either non-science or pseudoscience. The first part of my thesis will investigate the positions held by Karl Popper, Thomas Kuhn, Larry Laudan and Imre Lakatos in regards to drawing the line of demarcation between science and non-science. An analysis of their positions will buttress my final conclusion that there should not be a definitive line drawn amongst the two. Rather, we should accept that the demarcating line between science and pseudoscience is fuzzy at best. If a definitive line is to be drawn, dire medical and ethical consequences would result. Part 2 of my thesis addresses facts and values in science. Because the argument concerning the description of science is as old as science itself, I found it imperative to distinguish between facts and values. This debate, of course, intensifies when scientists are accused of the value-ladeness of their theories. Making a claim such as this invokes controversy, as science is typified by objective methods. I argue that to claim that science is value-laden is to reduce it to a subjective enterprise. My aim is to demonstrate that historically, scientific objectivity has increasingly influenced value-not the adverse.

The Emergence of Causation

Author: Gallow, Jeffrey Dmitri

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1615441658?accountid=14906

Abstract: Many contemporary philosophers are drawn to a doctrine of causal fundamentalism. This doctrine has its epistemic and its metaphysical tenets. The epistemic tenet holds that causation is to be investigated primarily by looking to the ground-floor level of reality. The metaphysical tenet of causal fundamentalism maintains that, once the causal structure of the fundamental level of reality is settled--once, that is, we know which fundamental physical events cause which other fundamental physical events--all of the world's causal structure is settled. This could either be because the fundamental causal structure is the only causal structure that there is to settle, or it could be because all other causal structure that there is in some sense reduces to that found at the fundamental physical level. The first part of the dissertation disputes both tenets of causal fundamentalism. Chapter 1 argues against the methodology of attempting to locate causation within the theories of fundamental physics without engaging in conceptual analysis. Chapter 2 argues that the world comes equipped with novel and irreducible causal structure at higher levels of description. Settling the world's fundamental causal structure does not suffice to settle all of the world's causal structure. Importantly, accepting this thesis does not commit us to the view that there are irreducible higher-level laws, or irreducible higher-level properties; it is entirely consistent with the view that all facts reduce to fundamental physical facts. The second part of the dissertation takes up the task of constructing an anti-fundamentalist theory of causation. On this theory, the causal relata are the events of parts of the world acquiring or retaining properties. In order for two events to be causally related, one must counterfactually depend upon the other, or else there must be a certain kind of chain of counterfactual dependence leading from the one to the other. This theory is broadly in the spirit of Lewis's 1973 counterfactual account of causation. Yet it is able to escape the numerous counterexamples which led even Lewis to eventually abandon that theory.

Anthrobiota: Human-microbe relationships on the edge of biological science

Author: Benezra, Amber

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/1501476590?accountid=14906

Abstract: This dissertation investigates microbes in the human gut as objects around which scientific and anthropological imperatives are emerging. Commensal bacteria are material and biological, alive and lively, agentive and constitutive of the majority of genes and cells in the human body. By commensal I mean the microbes that have co-evolved with humans for one hundred thousand years, and without which we could not digest food, fight infection, or live. What does it mean to think of human bodies as mostly microbial? In recent years metagenomic sequencing technology has provided new ways of seeing commensal bacteria in the human body, and these new scientific perspectives are revealing the impact indigenous microbes have on human health. What is at stake in these newly understood human-microbe relationships? Microbes are being enacted through cutting-edge science, sequencing and bioinformatic technologies, global public health programs, and probiotic interventions. Studies of microbes necessitate a micro-view reorientation to concepts of ecology, geography, nutrition, and data; a critical proximity to the details of micro-objects as well as attention to the macro-processes within which they are implicated. I argue that human/microbial relationships elide categories of the biological and social, self and other, individual and community. Based on fourteen months of fieldwork at The Gordon Lab at Washington University, where new gut microbe findings and research directions are emerging, I investigated the microbial conditions through which social scientists and human microbial ecologists are rethinking communities, interactions and environments; shifting analyses of life from entities to processes. Specifically, I followed commensal bacteria in the human gut as it traveled between the field (maternal and child nutritional intervention in Bangladesh) and the lab (microbial genomics and diet experiments). Scientists are evaluating how food, environment, and genes affect human gut microbes, and how those microbes in turn affect human health, illness, and evolution. Commensal microbes are transmitted and cultivated between humans through biological as well as social, intimate practices--such as feeding, affection, and birth. By accounting for microbes, and through interdisciplinary collaborations in the study of microbes, natural and social scientists can work toward co-accountable, ethical, and effective scientific practices.

I argue that if we share his perspective, Goodman's own solution to the New Riddle is undermined: the linguistic facts about the entrenchment of predicates are no more accessible than facts about which classes are relevant to nature. The result is that Goodman's arguments leave us in a predicament very much like that presented by the Kripke-Wittgenstein paradox about meaning.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Entrenchment; Goodman; Induction; Kripke-Wittgenstein paradox; New riddle of induction; Philosophy of Science; Philosophy; 0422:Philosophy; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is characterized by a reduction or an absence of enteric ganglia in the distal part of the bowel. It is one of the commonest gastrointestinal motility disorders in newborns. Cell replacement has been considered as a potential therapeutic method which provides a renewable source of cells capable of replacing or repairing tissues that have been damaged in some degenerative diseases. Although previous studies have shown that it was possible to use embryonic stem cells to derive neurons and glia after they were transplanted into the recipient guts of mice or rats, a number of problems remain unresolved. The aim of this study was to develop a method to isolate the skin-derived precursors from early postnatal mice, characterize these cells and investigate their therapeutic potential in the mouse model of HSCR. In the first part of the study, the skin-derived precursors were firstly isolated from EGFP mice at postnatal day 1 and cultured as neurospheres. These neurospheres were characterized by multiple immunofluorescence staining, cell proliferation assay and induced differentiation. It was shown that cells from the neurospheres expressed stem cell markers, capable of self-renewal and could be induced to form several types of cells in different differentiation media. The skin-derived cells cultured as neurospheres could be passaged many times in vitro . Their ability of self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation indicated that cells within the neurospheres were stem-liked cells. In the second part of the study, cells of the neurospheres derived the EGFP mouse skin at postnatal day 1 were transplanted to the recipient embryonic hindgut explants which were then maintained in an organotypic culture. The migration and differentiation of engrafted cells from the neurospheres in the recipient hindgut were shown to be influenced not only by the culture medium but also the genotypes of the recipient gut tubes. For instance, the grafted skin-derived precursors could differentiate into neuronal cells in the aganglionic embryonic gut segments isolated from Sox10 Dom/Dom and Sox10Dom/+ embryos but not in the normal ganglionic hindgut segments from Sox10+/+ wild type embryos. In the final part, the potential application of skin-derived precursors in vivo was investigated by transplanting them to the descending colon of newborn mice after laparotomy. The immunofluorescence localization showed that the skin-derived precursors colonized the descending colon, and the colonization and differentiation of the engrafted cells in the recipient descending colon were affected by the microenvironment of the colon. In conclusion, the skin-derived precursors isolated from postnatal mouse skin showed the properties of stem cells, including the ability of proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation into different cell types in vitro , and could also give rise to neuronal cells ex vivo in the hindgut segments which were deficient in neural crest cells. In addition, the colonization and differentiation of the engrafted cells in vivo were affected by the microenvironment of the recipient colon.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Stem cell; Dominant megacolon; Skin-derived precursors; Neural crest cells; Hirschsprung's disease; Aganglionic; Philosophy of Science; Philosophy; Theology; 0422:Philosophy; 0469:Theology; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={In this paper I present an account of how epistemology should be pursued. I challenge epistemological projects which focus exclusively on how our fundamental beliefs about the world--specifically our beliefs about inductive and mathematical knowledge--can be foundationally justified. To their detriment, these projects often ignore the naturalistic question of why we have these beliefs in the first place. Chapter one begins with an account of David Hume's doctrine of knowledge, which is read most often as bifurcating knowledge into two epistemological classes. I refer to this bifurcation as the Received View of Hume's epistemology. On this interpretation, knowledge divides exhaustively into relations of ideas, on the one hand, and matters of fact on the other. Chapter One concludes that attempts to justify either epistemological class unduly overemphasizes the importance of this distinction and risks undermining Hume's actual epistemological goals. I argue that Hume sought a naturalistic explanation of how humans acquire (inductive and mathematical) beliefs as opposed to an explanation that restricts epistemology to a skeptical project of demonstrating why our beliefs are ultimately unjustifiable. Skepticism plays an important role in Hume's epistemology, but this skepticism is less important than his more positive naturalistic project to explain how and why we have different kinds of beliefs. I argue that this latter point has significance beyond interpretive studies of Hume as it has normative implications for the study of knowledge in general: epistemologists should not only establish why our beliefs about the world are justified, but also provide a naturalistic explanation of the etiology of our beliefs. This latter project is often ignored--yet restricting epistemology to the foundational search for justifications cannot succeed on its own, for we can only articulate how our beliefs might be justified by expanding epistemology to include an account of how we acquire our beliefs in the first place. To make this broader point, I focus on movements within the philosophy of science and the philosophy of mathematics which attempt to establish an epistemic foundation to justify our knowledge claims. In Chapter Two, I analyze attempts within the philosophy of science to provide a solution to Hume's problem of induction via some sort of foundational a priori premise or axiom. In Chapter Three, I analyze the logicist and neo-logicist projects within the philosophy of mathematics to provide a foundation for mathematical knowledge--or at least arithmetic--using only basic logical principles. Both of these chapters discuss how these epistemological projects focus exclusively on securing foundations for inductive or mathematical knowledge. Interestingly, both are unsuccessful in achieving their respective justificatory goals. I argue that the ultimate reason for this failure, in both cases, is their exclusive focus on foundations. Thus, in light of these difficulties, Chapter Four concludes by suggesting that epistemology is better served by expanding its project to include a more Humean, naturalistic, and scientific understanding of both inductive and mathematical beliefs in lieu of projects focused exclusively on the epistemic justification of these beliefs. These two projects are "two sides of the same coin," so to speak. If we want to know what justifies our beliefs we have to know how we come to have our beliefs, and vice versa.},

        abstract={In quantum field theory (QFT), physical quantities are represented by a net of operator algebras indexed by spacetime region. Each local algebra comes equipped with a state-dependent pair of modular operators, (J,Δ), encoding vital information about the algebra's internal structure, the local state, and the relational structure of the net. These operators and the associated structure theory are the subject of Tomita-Takesaki modular theory . Despite its importance, the physical significance of modular theory remains murky, and philosophers of QFT have largely ignored it. This dissertation aims to help close the gap. It explores a series of deep connections between modular theory and spacetime geometry established by the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem (which identifies the modular operators attached to spacelike wedge regions in the vacuum sector with certain generators of the Poincaré group). Chapter 1 orients my project within the current philosophical literature on the foundations of QFT. I advocate a cosmopolitan stance towards the subject, incorporating tools from Lagrangian, constructive, and algebraic field theory alike. Adopting this stance, chapter 2 introduces the core mathematical ideas behind modular theory and discusses several important physical applications centered around the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem. Chapter 3 examines how modular theory can be used to give new geometric insight into the parity-charge-time (PCT) theorem. I argue that the key to understanding the mysterious connection between spatiotemporal orientation and charge structure entailed by the theorem lies in recognizing PCT symmetry as a single global reflection of quantum statespace. Chapter 4 turns to the vexed problem of localization in QFT. Modular theory tells us that at a fundamental level the world is thoroughly entangled. In spite of this, via the split/nuclearity conditions, modular theory also supplies critical tools needed to help explain approximately-localized emergent entities like particles and chairs. The final chapter contains a critique of the Connes-Rovelli thermal time hypothesis, a proposal to solve the problem of time in quantum gravity using modular theory. Although I conclude that the current proposal cannot provide a coherent gauge-free description of physical change in generally covariant settings, it does highlight an intriguing connection between modular structure and local dynamics in standard QFT.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Pure sciences; Localization; PCT theorem; Quantum field theory; Relativistic spacetime; Thermal time hypothesis; Tomita-Takesaki modular theory; Spacetime; Philosophy of Science; Quantum physics; 0599:Quantum physics; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={The present dissertation is an exploration of the effect of diversity on social contract formation and the evolution of cooperation. This work stems from the pioneering efforts of economist Arthur Robson, who first explored the role of costless pre-game communication in strategic interactions. When communication is permitted, individuals playing a game can condition their behavior on the signal received from their counterpart. For my purposes, I interpret these signals as racial markers or cultural identifiers, which in turn provides a formal framework to precisely study a number of issues relevant to political and social philosophy. My first chapter, "Diversity, Tolerance and the Social Contract", starts by formalizing the state of nature as a game in which individuals can either choose to remain in the state of nature or attempt to found a social contract. I assume there exists some natural diversity in the population, and that individuals are pre-disposed to behave cooperatively with those who are more similar to themselves. I uncover an interesting relationship between diversity, tolerance and the social contract. Social contract formation is possible but initially comes with a cost for both diversity and tolerance. That is to say, individuals quickly all adopt the same signal and only behave cooperatively with those who send similar signals. This, however, is not a long-term feature of the population. In the long run, individuals slowly become more tolerant, cooperating with those who are quite dissimilar to themselves. The circle of cooperation expands, and soon all can partake in a thriving social contract. My second chapter, "Racists and Minorities in Population Games", focuses on the welfare of racial minorities, as well as explores one means of expunging racist attitudes and behaviors from a population. I show that in a wide range of games, minorities are at a distinct disadvantage. Consider the Nash demand game, a canonical bargaining game in which a resource is to be divided between two individuals. I show that in this game, minority status translates into a bargaining disadvantage. In other words, the population tends to settle on an equilibrium in which individuals from theracial majority receive the bulk of the resource. Interestingly, this minority disadvantage is not due to differential abilities or effort, but is instead simply in virtue of the minority's relative size. Second, I consider one means of reducing racist behavior. If individuals are allowed to send a plastic signal that is independent of their fixed racial signal, then individuals tend to condition their behavior on the plastic signal of their counterpart, which in turn facilitates high levels of cooperation. My final chapter, "The Possibility of Pluralism", explores cooperation and diversity in the context of a liberal pluralistic society. In such a society, many different valid conceptions of the good would exist, and individuals would ideally be tolerant of different moral beliefs and practices. Yet under what conditions is such an arrangement possible? Taking my cue from the political philosopher Gregory Kavka, I investigate how disagreement among individuals with different value systems would be settled. Individuals can either compromise and find some middle ground, or dig their heels in and refuse to concede. Using computer simulations, I identify that conflict is minimized when, among other things, individuals are embedded on a social network and are allowed to employ somewhat sophisticated strategies, such as tit-for-tat.},

        abstract={From public reminders to sanitize drinking water to philosophical speculation on the sublime, this study documents how microscopical science appears in a wide range of cultural and intellectual concerns. Interweaving a genealogy of microscopy with readings of literary texts, I show how the microscope embodies certain epistemological formulations that disclose original literary and philosophical networks. Through readings of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Charles Sanders Peirce, Herman Melville, and Emily Dickinson, along with diverse intertexts from philosophy, science, and literature, I expose the influence that microscopy had on nineteenth century American metaphysics, spirituality, fiction, and figuration. It explores, for example, questions of invisibility and faith in early American writers such as John Winthrop, Jr. and Cotton Mather, who believed that the microscope presented a divinely mandated opportunity to fully comprehend God's universe, and follows through with Emerson's later arguments that the instrument endorses a dangerous mechanistic ideology at odds with his spiritual sensibilities. It explains how Peirce viewed the microscope as a means through which to rescue philosophy from crude and untenable metaphysics, how Melville embraced the microscopical to enact a theory of symbolism, how Dickinson meditated on the spiritual dangers of "looking too closely," and how writers from numerous disciplines have all struggled to make sense of extended human vision. The study closes by discussing the model of "deep time" literary history, and questioning the status of the aesthetic detail when placed on the vast scale of a universe expanded by optical instruments. This cosmic vastness threatens to annihilate the significance of human intellectual pursuits, leading to a "scaling-up" that I argue is best addressed in existentialist terms. The microscope made available a novel means of imagining the infinite while revealing the limits of natural perception, expanding assumed scales of understanding, and challenging inherently prejudiced biological categories and social stratifications. This work demonstrates how the microscope came to be, the polemics it provoked, the ideas it preserves, and the role it played in the formations of nineteenth century philosophy, science, fiction, and poetry.}, keywords={Language, literature and linguistics; Philosophy, religion and theology; Social sciences; Dickinson, Emily; Emerson, Ralph Waldo; Melville, Herman; Peirce, Charles Sanders; American studies; Philosophy of Science; American literature; 0323:American studies; 0591:American literature; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={Alfred Russel Wallace, whose independent discovery of natural selection prompted Charles Darwin to publish his magnum opus, On the Origin of Species, is perhaps better remembered for his contributions to biogeography than evolutionary theory. His namesake, the Wallace Line, delineates an abrupt and curious intangible boundary that separates Australian fauna from Asian Fauna. While one continent's fauna are often highly distinct from the other continent's fauna, their distinctiveness is relative to the vast oceanic or latitudinal separation. In contrast, Asia and Australia are connected by a string of contiguous islands that could presumably allow for a gradient of species dispersal. Counterintuitive to the understanding of naturalists in the 19 th century and beyond, the patterns of flora and fauna on the adjacent islands in the Australasian Archipelago are so remarkably different that the area cannot be treated as one single biogeographic region, nor can it be seen as a transition state. Wallace observed this, and attempted to sketch the line that marked the distinct separation. This line created a controversial outflow of opinions, well into the twentieth century, based on the exact delineation of the faunal barrier. Research concerning the biogeographic region's internal and external boundaries continues in a diversity of fields and subfields. Wallace's namesake and publications on the Malay Archipelago, its natural productions, biogeography, and conceptions of the natural world drew envy, ire, admiration and respect. His synthesis and integration of fields created an empire of science based on one region, due to that region's tropical diversity, that propelled science forward immensely, for better or worse, and deserves recognition for his immense contributions to the pursuit of scientific knowledge- an intellectual Wallace Line.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Social sciences; Biogeography; Evolution; Wallace; Wallacea; Wallace line; Philosophy of Science; Science history; 0585:Science history; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={The dissertation brings together approaches across the fields of physics, critical theory, literary studies, philosophy of physics, sociology of science, and history of science to synthesize a hybrid approach for instigating more rigorous and intense cross-disciplinary interrogations between the sciences and the humanities. I explore the concept of speculation in particle physics and science fiction to examine emergent critical approaches for working in the two areas of literature and physics (the latter through critical science studies), but with the expectation of contributing new insights to media theory, critical code studies, and also the science studies of science fiction. There are two levels of conversations going on in the dissertation; at the first level, the discussion is centered on a critical historiography and philosophical implications of the discovery Higgs boson in relation to its position at the intersection of old (current) and the potential for new possibilities in quantum physics; I then position my findings on the Higgs boson in connection to the double-slit experiment that represents foundational inquiries into quantum physics, to demonstrate the bridge between fundamental physics and high energy particle physics. The conceptualization of the variants of the double-slit experiment informs the aforementioned critical comparisons. At the second level of the conversation, theories are produced from a close study of the physics objects as speculative engine for new knowledge generation that are then reconceptualized and re-articulated for extrapolation into the speculative ontology of hard science fiction, particularly the hard science fiction written with the double intent of speaking to the science while producing imaginative and socially conscious science through the literary affordances of science fiction. The works of science fiction examined here demonstrate the tension between the internal values of physics in the practice of theory and experiment and questions on ethics, culture, and morality. Nevertheless, the dissertation hopes to show the beginnings of a possibility, through the contentious but generative space provided by speculative physics, to produce more cross-collaborative thinking between physics as represented by the hard sciences, and science fiction representing the objects of literary enterprise and creative evolution.},

        abstract={"Apparatus Poetica" considers how four poets in the late modernist tradition reconceive the potentials of poetic language in order to address the question of advanced technology. Outlining challenges posed to language by communications industries, information theory, computation, and the threat of nuclear war, I show how four poets--James Merrill, Muriel Rukeyser, H.D., and Jack Spicer--explore affinities and crucial distinctions between poetry and technology. Through their experiments in what I call "apparatus poetics," these poets denaturalize culturally embedded assumptions surrounding technology's "neutrality" and poetry's expressive "purity." They do so through procedural innovations in the genre of the poetic epic, that form not coincidentally deemed by modernist anthropologists as the earliest human memory-technology. I begin with a discussion of how the montage apparatus of testimonial poetry in Rukeyser's The Book of the Dead works to indict industrial capital's technological tactics of historical effacement. I next discuss how Jack Spicer, working as a structural linguist in the age of IBM, uses a late modernist method, the "serial lyric," to set up a confrontation between poetic consciousness and language. Spicer casts the old predicament of thought's alienation from language in a new light defined by contemporary forms of technological emergence (especially computational intelligence). In the historical moment where databases begin to supplant cultural archives, H.D.'s Helen in Egypt meditates on translation and disintegration at the virtual horizon of memory and myth. I attend to how H.D.'s late-career epic revives an earlier, modernist moment of inquiry into the "machine mind" and "mnemic technology" through her collaboration with Sigmund Freud. I conclude with an exploration of how James Merrill's The Changing Light at Sandover engages language's aleatory powers to situate inspiration's accidents amid uncertain historical and technological horizons. This dissertation explores how these late modernists use language's techne to rethink mid-century historical forces catalyzed by technology. Insisting on language's poetic ability to exceed instrumentalized capture, these poets share an interest in theorizing new ethical relations for reconnecting "subject" and "process" in an age when forms of collectivity are undergoing rapid technological redefinition.}, keywords={Language, literature and linguistics; Philosophy, religion and theology; Late modernism; History and philosophy of science; American; Poetry; Technology and literature; Twentieth century; Merrill, James; Rukeyser, Muriel; Doolittle, Hilda; Spicer, Jack; H.D; Philosophy of Science; American literature; 0591:American literature; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={In recent years, there have been several ways in which researchers have attempted to integrate psychotherapy and neuroscience research. Neuroscience has been proposed as a method of addressing lingering questions about how best to integrate psychotherapy theories and explain their efficacy. For example, some psychotherapy outcome studies have included neuroimaging of participants in order to propose neurobiological bases of effective psychological interventions (e.g., Paquette et al., 2003). Other theorists have used cognitive neuroscience research to suggest neurobiological correlates of various psychotherapy theories and concepts (e.g., Schore, 2012). These efforts seem to embody broader historical trends, including the hope that neuroscience can resolve philosophical questions about the relationship between mind and body, as well as the popular appeal of contemporary brain research. In this hermeneutic dissertation I examined a popular neuropsychotherapy text in order to explore the historical fit between neuroscience and psychotherapy. The study identifies the possible understandings of the self (i.e., what it means to be human) that could arise from Western therapy discourses that are based on neuroscientific interpretations of psychotherapy theories. The methodology of this dissertation consisted of a critical textual analysis of Louis Cozolino's (2010) The Neuroscience of Psychotherapy: Healing the Social Brain. The primary content, rhetorical strategies, and recurring themes in Cozolino's book were outlined and interpreted from a hermeneutic perspective. This included a historical critique of Cozolino's claims about the origins, purpose, and efficacy of psychotherapy, his assertions about the relationship between self and brain, and examples of his psychotherapy case vignettes. Rhetorical strategies in his writing included analogy, ambiguity, speculative language, and figures of speech such as metaphor and personification. A discussion of these findings addressed the implications of Cozolino's efforts with regards to patient care, psychotherapy theory integration, and the possible effects that these efforts may have on the profession of psychology.

        abstract={This dissertation is an historical ontology of the vacuum in theoretical physics from Dirac to Zeldovich. It traces changing views of the ontology of the vacuum though communities of both quantum theorists and general "relativists." Rather than a traditional micro study of one actor, or a small group of connected actors, it is a "meso" history, following the idea of the vacuum across approximately 55 years and from the United States to the Soviet Union. This meso-scale analysis allows me to mediate between the individual concerns of historical actors at the chapter-level and a broader historical-philosophical question at the dissertation-level: how can we be realists about unobservable theoretical entities like the vacuum in the light of changing ontologies? However, too fine a distinction must not be drawn between ontologies and epistemologies here. An overall theme of the dissertation is the connection between the tools theorists used and their ontological pictures. Chapters cover P.A.M. Dirac; Julian Schwinger and Richard Feynman; John Archibald Wheeler; Roger Penrose; Sidney Coleman; and Vladimir Fock and Yakov Zeldovich. All chapters are based on archival research except the final body-chapter on Fock and Zeldovich, which is based on materials in translation. I make a positive case for the claim that one can be a realist about theoretical entities like the vacuum only when considered from a Deluezian, differential perspective.

        abstract={Can so-called non-cognitive values be used legitimately in good science? I argue that they have a legitimate role in several areas of science, namely the context of discovery, the context of investigation, and the context of application, but that they do not have a legitimate role in the area of scientific theory assessment. In this area they ought to be avoided because their use in this area makes for bad science. I then use the debate about whether or not race is a biological concept as an application and case study to illustrate the use of the values which ought to be used for assessing theories, cognitive values. I conclude that biological race is not real and we can make this judgment without using non-cognitive values. In the introduction I clarify various issues involved in the values debate. I then explain why I believe that the disagreement regarding whether or not race is biologically real makes for a helpful case study when considering the role of values in science. I show that the disagreement is often seen as being motivated by various non-cognitive values; that is to say, each side claims the other is being inappropriately influenced by non-cognitive values. In Chapter 1 I lay out the various arguments for and against whether ancient civilizations held to the concept of race and show that there are problems with both sides of the issue and thus, neither side can say that the fact that the ancients believe one way or the other helps their case, as is often claimed. In Chapter 2 I critically examine some of the major theories of race and suggest that they do not work. I conclude that while we can find all kinds of differences between groups these differences do not seem to allow us to make any meaningful biological distinctions. I then raise the question again whether or not non-cognitive values have influenced the race debate. In Chapter 3 I work through an account of how non-cognitive values function in various areas of science and argue that in good science non-cognitive values ought to be avoided in the context of assessment. Chapter 4 lays out an account of why cognitive, what I call epistemic and non-epistemic values, are to be used to assess theory choice. I argue that other so-called non-cognitive values for instance, ideological, psychological, ethical values, etc., ought not to be used. I argue that only those values that aid in justifying or directly assessing beliefs as true (epistemic values) or those that aid in our understanding and explanation (non-epistemic cognitive values) ought to be used to judge a theory as good, and non-cognitive values do not do this. Finally, I suggest that the lack of consensus on the biological reality of race may be due to different approaches motivated by different research programs and not necessarily the inappropriate influence of non-cognitive values. Chapter 5 attempts to apply the notion of the appropriate use of values in scientific assessment. I make a distinction between the question, "What is a biological race?" and the question, "Do biological races exist?" I maintain that these are two different questions and result in different metaphysical assumptions about the existence of race, and thus lead to different research programs. I pose two problems facing those in research programs that assume and posit the reality of biological race, a classification problem, which seems to cause the notion of race to fail what I call the non-epistemic cognitive values test, and a sorting problem, which seems to cause the notion of race to fail what I call the epistemic values test. I maintain that as a result of these problems race is not biologically real.},

To explore this question, it will examine three historical case studies, all taking place in Western Europe in the 18th and 19th Centuries. These historical case studies will focus on the beginnings of censuses in Great Britain, Germany and France. They exhibit that the relationship between national statistics and state control is complex and non-linear, and that the absence of statistics is also a means through which very strong governmental power can be asserted. Overall, this paper advocates for a greater societal awareness of the complicated implications of national statistics.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Social sciences; Government; Governmentality; Population; Quantification; State; Statistics; Philosophy of Science; Science history; 0585:Science history; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={The landscape of science education is changing. Scientific research and the academy are both becoming increasingly complex, competitive, interdisciplinary, and international. Many federal research agencies, scientific professional societies, and science educators seem to agree on the importance of strong ethics education to help young scientists navigate this increasingly craggy terrain. But, what actually should be done? When it comes to teaching ethics to future scientists, is the apparent current emphasis on basic responsible conduct of research (RCR) sufficient, or should moral theory also be taught in science ethics education? In this thesis I try engage this question by focusing on an existing, related debate on whether moral theory should be part of teaching professional ethics more generally. After delving into the respective approaches promoted by the three primary participants in this debate (C. E. Harris, Bernard Gert, and Michael Davis) I unpack their views in order to ascertain their practical application potential and relative benefits. I then take these findings and apply them to ethics education in science, paying particular attention to its purported learning objectives. In the end I conclude that the presentation of these objectives suggests that moral theory may well be required in order for these objectives of ethics education in science to be fully achieved.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Education; Ethics; Moral theory; Philosophy; Professional; Science; Philosophy of Science; Education philosophy; 0394:Ethics; 0402:Philosophy of Science; 0998:Education philosophy},

        abstract={Social theory explanations commonly take one of two forms. Accounts couched in terms of macroscopic entities such as institutions, culture, class, structure and tradition tend to privilege stability and regularity. Individualistic explanations, on the other hand, take these entities to be ultimately reducible to free actions of individuals and are most adept at explaining transformation and volatility in the social realm. These two forms of explanation are rooted in radically different ontological and normative assumptions, and no attempt to connect them has garnered wide acceptance to date. This dissertation once re-examines the tension between them, which has become known as the "structure vs. agency" debate, by drawing on and extending the insights of "theories of practice", a literature that locates the junction of structure and agency in the routines of ordinary daily activities. The dissertation begins by critically examining two extant theories of practice. One originates in Pierre Bourdieu, Anthony Giddens, and William Sewell's responses to structuralism; the other is articulated by Theodore Schatzki, who draws on Ludwig Wittgenstein to characterize practice as a semantic lens through which social actors make sense of the world. An alternative theory of practice is then developed, inspired by Charles Taylor's Heideggerian conception of embodied agency. This theory of "embodied practice" advances a novel formulation of the structure-agent relationship. Through a fine-grained analysis of the cognitive and informational processes by which practices project a semantic dimension onto the world, embodied practice theory renders robust forms of personal agency compatible with certain forms of semantic macrostructures. The dissertation goes on to describe how embodied practices can account for both change and stability in society and how the concept of an embodied practice may be profitably employed in applied social analysis and political theory.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Social sciences; Agency; Cognitive science; Practice theory; Structure; Social research; Philosophy of Science; 0344:Social research; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={Historians of science regard John Herschel (1792.1871) as one of the most influential British natural philosophers of the nineteenth century. He made important contributions in chemistry, optics, and the philosophy of science, but he was most widely regarded for his astronomical work. His investigations and publications on double stars, nebulae, variable stars, and constellation reform extended throughout his career and form an important chapter in sidereal astronomy prior to the advent of astrophysics. This dissertation is the first extensive survey of Herschel's stellar astronomy, drawing upon his correspondence and unpublished diaries and manuscripts in addition to his scientific papers and texts. After a survey of historical ideas regarding the physical nature of the stars, the study examines Herschel's relationship with nineteenth-century positional astronomy and argues that Herschel viewed star catalogues as a means of obtaining information on the physical nature of stars. By exploring Herschel's contributions in double star and variable star research, this study illustrates how Herschel brought these fields of inquiry from the astronomical periphery, making them subjects of physico-mathematical research endeavors pursued by multiple observers. The work next contextualizes Herschel's prismatic analysis, situating Herschel's spectral investigations within his optical and photographical researches and offering an explanation of his ultimate response to spectroscopy. Finally, it concludes with a survey of Herschel's influence on science writers throughout the nineteenth century to illustrate how his stellar conceptions were accepted and disseminated more broadly. This treatment of Herschel's stellar astronomy addresses broader questions in the history of nineteenth--]century science. Firstly, it shows the evolution of conceptions regarding the stars in the decades leading up to spectroscopy. Drawing on assumptions common since the time of Copernicus, Herschel was instrumental in establishing and communicating many newly measured stellar properties. Secondly, this investigation complicates the division between amateur and professional astronomers during this period as Herschel attempted to recruit members of both observing communities for his projects. Herschel's work marks the transition of sidereal astronomy from being the sole property of those with large telescopes as he advocated for programs in which even naked eye observers could make important contributions to understanding the stars.},

        abstract={In this thesis we focus mainly on the field of philosophy of the mind and learning, one of its particularly important elements, where from the early beginning of thinking about a human as a thinking "machine" to the contemporary teaching about this problem, we continuously observe two ways of explaining: A mysterian one, which posits that the mind is something unique and is a source of some mysteries which are characteristic only of studies of the mind. Consequently, we could conclude that the mind is completely different from anything else in the world and must therefore have a special ontological position. A naturalistic one, which posits that the mind can, or even must be, "naturalised", so that mental conditions and processes are describable with the language of science: physics, cognitive science or languages of other natural sciences. According to this approach we expect that a human being is a part of nature, and the processes which happen in he human being, including mental processes, are also a part of nature. Both approaches try to find the truth, but both of them use totally different methods and tools and interpret findings from totally different theoretical backgrounds and origins. In this thesis, we advocate a naturalistic approach, based on current natural sciences, their methods, and reductionism in the theory of the mind with an emphasis on engine learning as a paradigmatic case of an algorithmically reducible mental process with the possibility of application on human beings. In this case, when the machine is learning, we can reduce this learning to algorithms or physical processes. In addition, mental processes in human can be reduced and written as dynamic models. Such reductionist approaches in the frame of philosophy, cognitive science neurobiology, neuro-computer science and artificial intelligence often pose the question of what connection there is, if any, between the development of cognitive science and neuro-computer science. So far, no final answer has been found to three key questions in this field: Can we entirely (neuro)model and simulate brain functioning with the help of current computer technologies? Can the development of neuro-computer science and artificial intelligence lead to the replacement of human beings and their natural intelligence ( directly - a humanoid robot, engine or machine which does humans' jobs; or indirectly - a computer "teacher", an intelligent tutor, which performs only humans' mental functions). Can a human - his metal life --be reduced via mathematical algorithms to brain processes? For example, is there such a system of differential equations by which the mind could be written and which could be used to bridge a gap between two different sciences, i.e. psychology as a special science and physics as a basic science. This thesis will answer these questions. The thesis is designed along the historical principle, where from the early beginnings of philosophical thinking about the mind we continue through the past and present to the near and distant future of the idea of artificial human beings and argue for a naturalistic approach, based on current natural sciences and their methods, and reductionism in the theory of the mind with an emphasis on the possibilities of algorithmic reduction of mental processes in human beings on dynamic models.

        abstract={In this dissertation I discern what Carl Jung calls the mandala image of the ultimate archetype of unity underlying and structuring cosmos and psyche by pointing out parallels between his transpersonal psychology and Stanford physicist Leonard Susskind's string theory. Despite his atheistic, materialistically reductionist interpretation of it, I demonstrate how Susskind's string theory of holographic information conservation at the event horizons of black holes, and the cosmic horizon of the universe, corroborates the following four topics about which Jung wrote: (1) his near-death experience of the cosmic horizon after a heart attack in 1944; ( 2) his equation relating psychic energy to mass, "Psyche=highest intensity in the smallest space" (1997, 162), which I translate into the equation, Psyche=Singularity; (3) his theory that the mandala, a circle or sphere with a central point, is the symbolic image of the ultimate archetype of unity through the union of opposites, which structures both cosmos and psyche, and which rises spontaneously from the collective unconscious to compensate a conscious mind torn by irreconcilable demands (1989, 334-335, 396-397); and (4) his theory of synchronicity. I argue that Susskind's inside-out black hole model of our Big Bang universe forms a geometrically perfect mandala: a central Singularity encompassed by a two-dimensional sphere which serves as a universal memory bank. Moreover, in precise fulfillment of Jung's theory, Susskind used that mandala to reconcile the notoriously incommensurable paradigms of general relativity and quantum mechanics, providing in the process a mathematically plausible explanation for Jung's near-death experience of his past, present, and future life simultaneously at the cosmic horizon. Finally, Susskind's theory also provides a plausible cosmological model to explain Jung's theory of synchronicity--meaningful coincidences may be tied together by strings at the cosmic horizon, from which they radiate inward as the holographic "movie" of our three-dimensional world.},

        abstract={My dissertation traces and analyzes the identifications with science that emerge in the rhetorical tradition of the multimodal exhibition of scientific objects, concepts, processes, and practices in the museum context. I demonstrate how multimodal exhibits in science centers have embedded implicit instruction in scientific method and its value; these identifications with science are further reinforced and complicated by wider cultural expectations and ambitions for science and science centers, and how those expectations and ambitions come to be realized in the built spaces of the science centers enclosing the exhibits themselves. I argue that the display of science exhibits within the context of science centers' built spaces reproduces a rhetorical tradition that encourages visitors to respond according to sense-making conventions that are historic in origins, and which privilege a "folk epistemology of common sense empiricism." The compelling characterization of science as a process conducted through careful observation and inference was separated from the dominant definition of science when experimental science displaced analytical science and its practice moved from private homes and museums to university laboratories. In the twentieth century, through their reproduction of exhibits' "naked eye science," museums--both natural history and the emerging institution of the science center--preserved the now-outdated theory of knowledge-making with objects. As cultural expectations and ideas about science changed during the twentieth century, the needs of local communities hosting science centers changed, and science center institutions and buildings were adapted to address new educational, economic and civic demands. While exhibits' sense-making functions remained based on the assumption that science is done through careful observation of past events, new architectures and built spaces enclosing those exhibits realized celebratory functions for their surrounding communities, conferring on the exhibits the community's value for science as a vehicle of economic and social progress, an exciting exploration of received facts, and a process to be mastered by the "noble scientist." My study reveals not only varying levels of complexity by which communicative modes function together to realize scientific meanings, but also how the convergence of historic, social, and material factors influence the meanings that exhibits and their exhibit designers may make available to visitors. Additionally, because some research suggests that the primary effect of the museum experience is not better understanding of science, but a new excitement or curiosity about it, understanding the affective aspects of identification in science centers can help scholars better understand how attitudes towards science are shaped in specific contexts. The celebratory identifications with science are the most prominent aspect of the museum experience, and as a result, these science centers promote an outdated conception of science that is exciting, but sets up its audience--American children and families, primarily--for unexpected disappointment and frustration when they encounter the true intellectual challenges and laborious repetition of scientific practice. Further, those celebratory functions may be politicized and co-opted by other institutions with motives that run directly counter to those of the science center.}, keywords={Language, literature and linguistics; Philosophy, religion and theology; Communication and the arts; Rhetoric of science; Science accommodation; Museum studies; Visual rhetoric; Material rhetoric; Multimodal rhetoric; Science and technology centers; Epistemology; Philosophy of Science; Multimedia Communications; Rhetoric; 0681:Rhetoric; 0730:Museum studies; 0558:Multimedia Communications; 0393:Epistemology; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={There is a tension between being both morally and naturalistically serious because it is doubtful that features philosophers have ascribed to moral facts in order to explain why we should take them seriously can be given a naturalistic accounting. Yet even serious naturalists who think the tension is real and troubling persist in trying to be serious moralists. I do not think they can do so on their own terms. Thus the purpose of this dissertation: to inquire after a perfectly natural way to think about morality, one that begins by examining the colloquially moral behaviors of the natural human animal, one that also demands that we take morality seriously. I call the view that emerges 'Bio-Enhanced Constructivism'. It consists of two theses: the Human Nature Thesis saying it belongs to the human species to have peculiarly moral desires, and the Biological Construction Claim saying moral facts are determined by certain evaluations that these desires dispose us to make. I defend the view in three steps. First I present evidence from the biological and psychological sciences for the Human Nature Thesis. Then I argue that the Biological Construction Claim is the only viable way to make sense of how there could moral facts determined by our evaluations. Finally, I consider a great number of objections claiming to undermine the justification a bio-enhanced constructivist offers for our taking morality seriously and I show that none of these objections is able to uphold its claim.},

In "Quantum Entanglement, Bohmian Mechanics, and Humean Supervenience," I defend David Lewis's metaphysical doctrine of Humean supervenience, and traditional metaphysical reductionism more generally, against an alleged holistic threat encapsulated in the non-separability argument from quantum entanglement. I argue that, contrary to popular belief, realism about quantum mechanics is compatible with Humean reductionism. In "Humean Scientific Explanation," I consider a different sort of charge, aimed at Humean accounts of laws of nature in particular, which says that Humean laws cannot underwrite satisfactory scientific explanations. I distinguish three Humean answers to this allegation that, interestingly, correspond to three ways of thinking about relations of grounding, or metaphysical explanation, linking Humean laws and their instances, all of which are consistent with the doctrine of Humean supervenience. In "Two Notions of Holism," I suggest that metaphysical reductionists and holists alike can, and should, recognize the holistic predictive structure of quantum theory. Committed metaphysical holists then may motivate their metaphysical position as offering an explanation for the predictive holism found in quantum theory. In pursuing this strategy, however, metaphysical holists may draw on explanatory assumptions that their reductive opponents need not accept.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Holism; Humeanism; Humean supervenience; Metaphysical explanation; Quantum entanglement; Metaphysics; Philosophy of Science; Philosophy; 0396:Metaphysics; 0422:Philosophy; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={Studies have shown that obesity is linked to insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes, yet the exact mechanism(s) linking excess adiposity to increased disease risk is unknown. Studies suggest that visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and liver fat (LF) contribute to the development of IR and risk for T2D. However, this theory is challenged by the fact that overweight and obese African Americans (AAs) have less VAT and LF than Hispanics, yet share a similar risk for IR and T2D. Recent data suggest that excess adipose tissue contributes to chronic inflammation, thereby promoting the development of IR and other metabolic complications. Supporting this idea, recent studies have found that anti-inflammatory drugs, such as salsalate, decrease markers of inflammation and improve glucose control in Caucasian adults with T2D and/or impaired glucose control. Overall, the purpose of this dissertation was multi-faceted where we focused on both the location and inflammatory state of adipose tissue. In order to examine adipose tissue inflammation, we developed a novel biopsy method to sample large quantities of intact subcutaneous adipose tissue for a variety of research purposes (e.g., cell sorting, histology, gene expression). This allowed us to perform a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in obese Hispanic young adults in order to determine whether any salsalate-induced metabolic improvements were mediated by changes in adipose tissue inflammation. From these studies, we show that high LF was more strongly associated with decreased insulin sensitivity and β-cell function among African Americans (AAs) compared to Hispanics. Our results suggest that Hispanics exhibited appropriate β-cell compensation for liver fat induced insulin resistance where AAs did not. These findings may partially explain why AAs are a great risker for T2D, despite having lower levels of LF and VAT when compared to Hispanics. Our work focusing on adipose tissue inflammation led us to develop a novel biopsy method where we were able to sample large quantities of intact adipose tissue (~1.5 g). This method allowed us to systematically examine the effects of salsalate on various markers of adipose tissue inflammation. Overall, we confirmed that salsalate improved metabolic outcomes related to T2D risk in otherwise healthy obese Hispanics. Our finding suggests that these improvements occurred in the absence of any significant alterations to adipose tissue inflammation. Taken together, our results suggest that although specific patters of fat distribution and inflammation contribute to T2D risk, salsalate does not target adipose tissue inflammation. Future studies should examine other treatment strategies and/or therapeutic targets in an effort to decrease obesity-associated inflammation as a means to decrease disease risk.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Adipose tissue; Ectopic fat; Health disparities; Minority health; Obesity; Type 2 diabetes; Philosophy of Science; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={Do emotions help explain our behaviors? Can they condemn us, excuse us, orr mitigate our moral responsibility orr blameworthiness? Can they explain our rationality and irrationality, orr warrant such attributions? Can they be justified orr warranted? Are they constitutive aspects of our consciousness, identity, characters, virtues, orr epistemic status? The answer to these questions, at least to a significant extent, depends on what emotions are. This illustrates the importance of what emotions are to academics across multiple disciplines, as well as to members of governing bodies, organizations, communities, and groups. Given the great importance of emotions to various aspects of our lives, this dissertation is about the relevance of the topic of emotion as an area of study for the discipline of philosophy. This dissertation is also broadly about the need to bridge the interests, concerns, and collective bodies of knowledge between various distinct disciplines, thereby contributing to the process of unifying knowledge across the various disciplines within the realm of academia. The primary aim in this dissertation is to initiate the unification of the interests, concerns, and collective bodies of knowledge across disciplines of academia. To do so, however, this dissertation aims to bridge some disciplinary divides between the disciplines of philosophy and psychology. I fulfill this aim by first demonstrating that interdisciplinary research and theorizing is needed within the disciplines of philosophy and psychology. I do this by considering how the problem of skepticism arises within these two disciplines. I also derive, propose, and argue for the acceptance of a new foundation for academic research and theorizing in response to the problem of skepticism. I refer to my proposal, in general, as The Proposal for Unification without Consilience (UC).},

I argue that switching the focus to structure allows the realist to better deal with problems of theory-change, and to better make sense of contemporary physics. I go on to offer a specific version of structural realism based on an understanding of structures as networks of relations between objects that are nothing more than places in structures. My view allows that there are objects and relations, but reverses the usual order of dependence: objects depend on relations rather than the other way around.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Structural realism; Scientific theories; Structures; Objects; Philosophy of Science; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={This dissertation offers a new solution to the problem of causation in the physical world. Fundamental physics leaves little space for causation. Causation is local and asymmetric, but physical laws are global and time-symmetric. However, causal notions are indispensable. In particular we need causation to make sense of effective strategies. The problem of causation in the physical world is the challenge of reconciling the a-causal physical picture of the world with the need for causation. Chapter 1 describes the problem in detail and proposes a new methodology to solve it. The proper method to handle the problem isn't conceptual analysis. Rather, solutions to the problem should be judged on how well they physically explain actual facts about effective strategies. Chapter 2 examines the main attempts to solve the problem. I argue that they all face various problems. In particular, current attempts to locate causation in the physical world all have trouble making sense of the fact that we need causal knowledge to make rational decisions. To solve this problem, the first step is to provide a satisfactory explanation of why only those correlations that are (intuitively) causal can be exploited for the purpose of securing desired outcomes. In chapter 3, I propose such an explanation. I argue that causal correlations are the only ones that can be exploited according to evidential decision theory (EDT). This is a surprising claim, since EDT is widely thought to recommend acting for the sake of outcomes one cannot cause. I arguethat this is actually not the case, and that EDT in fact provides a plausible account of exploitable correlations. In chapter 4, I use this account to offer a new solution to the problem of causation in a physical world. I argue that causal dependence is a matter of the cause and the effect standing in certain probabilistic relations to a third event called a probabilistic intervention. Probabilistic interventions are events that need not involve agency but nonetheless mimic certain crucial features of deliberation. I argue that this account provides a plausible solution to the problem of causation in a physical world.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Causation; Physics; Decision theory; Philosophy of Science; Philosophy; 0422:Philosophy; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={For the past three decades, the concept of 'mechanism' has regained centrality in science as well as philosophy of science. Recently, philosophers of science have become interested in mechanistic approaches to scientific explanation. Instead of appealing to laws, especially within the biological sciences, the new mechanists argue that scientists are able to provide a successful explanation by identifying and manipulating variables in a model of a mechanism thereby determining how those variables are situated in the mechanism. The explanation consists of explaining how those variables act and interact to produce the phenomenon of interest. So, models of mechanisms help scientists explain how a phenomenon is produced, how some task is carried out, and how the mechanism as a whole behaves. Contra the new mechanistic philosophy of science, I argue that, surprisingly, Wesley Salmon's 1984 Mark Transmission account, thought by some to be irrelevant for the biological sciences, in fact provides a more comprehensive approach to mechanistic explanations within the biological sciences. In chapter one, I outline current mechanistic approaches, and note the many favorable attributes of the current mechanistic accounts. However, there are some ways in which these accounts may be improved, such as the ability to handle contemporary complex biological systems, better incorporating the complexities of the mechanistic environment, offering explanations for ephemeral and irregular mechanisms, offering explanations for cases of negative causation, and offering illustrations of the mechanistic approach within contemporary scientific practice. In chapter two, I introduce the Salmon-Roe approach which considers mechanisms differently than the new mechanists, in that causal processes entering into causal interactions are what I refer to as mechanisms. Causal processes are the mechanisms that operate in our universe and are precisely what scientists trace and model during their research. Also, statistically relevant information regarding these causal processes is continually gathered by scientists and helps to provide generalized information that then becomes scientific knowledge. In this way, the Salmon-Roe approach offers an iterative and progressive picture of scientific explanation. By introducing and utilizing a contemporary mechanism of interest within the biological sciences throughout the dissertation, I show how one can rightfully and fruitfully utilize an enhanced version of Salmon's work to explain biological phenomena. I then argue, in chapter three, that accounts of mechanistic explanation ought to take more seriously the importance of the mechanism environment, especially when providing explanations for complex biological systems. To this end, I show how the Salmon-Roe approach properly magnifies the importance of mechanism environment both in explanation as well as scientific practice, provides a way in which to demarcate the mechanism from other external factors, and allows for a perspectival approach to mechanism levels that does not require that scientists decompose mechanisms into component parts. Chapter four is concerned with how the Salmon-Roe approach accounts for or results in scientific generalizations. I argued that scientists utilize particular experimental findings (token mechanism) and cluster that information alongside other relevantly similar token mechanisms. The result of this process is a robust mechanism taxonomy, or grouping of similar mechanisms then used to provide more general explanations. It is through this process, scientists are then able to construct generalizations. Finally, I argue, within chapter five, that other mechanistic accounts of explanation are ill-equipped to handle cases of negative causation. Conversely, negative causation cases are easily remedied when utilizing the Salmon-Roe notion of mechanisms, in that talk of negative causation always signals a different mechanism than we may have first thought. Once this is understood, we can shift our focus from the seemingly bewildering mechanism and focus on the appropriate mechanism that produces the appropriate phenomenon in question. In sum, by focusing on processes, rather than entities and activities, I argue that several problems that once plagued the new mechanists' approaches can be remedied. Within my dissertation I show how the Salmon-Roe approach to mechanistic explanations can solve problems regarding generalities, mechanism demarcation, reduction, regularity, negative causation, the mechanism environment, and scientific practice. The result is a revamped account of 'mechanism' that provides a better understanding of scientific explanation and scientific discovery.},

        abstract={My dissertation lies at the philosophical intersection of the American pragmatist tradition and contemporary epistemology. By treating truth, justification, and belief as matters of degree, I develop a measure of knowledge that captures all of our fundamental intuitions while providing answers to the problems of epistemic luck, skepticism, and scientific pessimism. Traditionally, knowledge is understood as justified true belief that is not due to luck. My project follows this general outline. First, I describe the pragmatist understanding of truth first articulated by Charles Sanders Peirce in the late nineteenth century. My first chapter offers Peirce's understanding of truth as the best explanation of our intuitive understanding of what it is for a proposition to be the case and shows how we can understand Peirce's theory as compatible with contemporary theories of truth. In my second chapter, I develop a theory of belief such that an agent believes a proposition when she acts as if that proposition were a rule governing her behavior. On this view, beliefs are theoretical entities posited to make sense of other agents' actions. Following this account of belief, I describe what it is for a belief to be true and argue that sense of truth in which beliefs are true is best understood as an approximation of the full descriptive truth. My third, fourth, and fifth chapters are an account of justification. Chapter 3 is a descriptive account of synchronic justification: we all reject or accept propositions in accordance with maximizing the coherence of our belief-networks. Chapters 4 and 5 articulate and then defend a new measure of diachronic justification, which is a measure of the degree to which a belief is appropriately revisable and therefore embeddable in an ongoing process of fallibilist inquiry. I develop a novel formal quantification of methodological justification and show that it gives plausible results when applied to popular cases. My final chapter brings justification, truth, and belief together into a scalar knowledge measure. I locate my theory in ongoing epistemic inquiry, describing its conceptual advantages over rival theories as well as its ability to replicate their successes.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Belief; Inquiry; Justification; Knowledge; Peirce; Truth; Epistemology; Philosophy of Science; Philosophy; 0422:Philosophy; 0393:Epistemology; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={The aim of this thesis, firstly, is to identify the dominate scholarly reactions to the biological writing of Sigmund Freud, particularly regarding his 1920 text, Beyond the Pleasure Principle. Considering the cluster of biological observations therein, now infamous for their anachronism, this study does not offer an index of Freud's scientific accuracy. Rather, I seek to explore the precarious relationship between two areas of investigation found in Beyond: the individual psyche and the development of the organism. Although psychoanalysis is often portrayed as primarily concerned with conflicts local to an individual's history, Freud so often portrays the tensions between the individual and his or her species as similarly important to human pathology, a notion explored in the first chapter. In the following chapter, I propose that Freud's biological imagination can be seen as less of a tangent to psychoanalytic theory once one identifies moments of its logical priority and originality. Some concepts in Freud's intellectual arsenal appear preconfigured by biological conjecture or fancy such as traumatic neurosis, which has a distinct evolutionary dilemma at the core of its formulization. Lastly, the trajectory of Freud's scientific speculation in Beyond is, issuing from its very design, intended for the enquiry of others. It is in this respect that I interrogate an ultimatum: is Freudian energetics merely an obscure metaphor to be interpreted or, as Jacques Lacan seems to suggest, a component of a theory of metaphoricity itself?},

        abstract={Natural science tells a story about what the world is like. But what kind of story is this supposed to be? On a popular (realist) view, this story is meant to provide the best possible explanations of the aspects of the world with which we are all acquainted. A realist also thinks that the story should in some sense provide explanations that are probable in light of our evidence, and that these explanations ought to fit together into a coherent whole. These requirements turn out to be surprisingly hard to satisfy given the received view of how scientific theories are evaluated. However, I argue that if scientific theories are evaluated comparatively rather than absolutely for explanatory purposes - optimifically rather than satisficingly - then we can provide a fully realist view of the connections between explanation, probability, and coherence. It is one thing to say what science's story of the world ought ideally be like, it is another to say that the story as it is actually being told lives up to this ideal. Do we have good reasons to believe that the picture as it is currently being presented to us is true, at least for the most part? "Yes," answer realists, "as long as our theories are empirically successful." Anti-realists respond that success is a poor guide to truth, appealing to the rather depressing history of successful theories that turned out to be false. Although I count myself among realists, I argue that realists have done themselves a disservice by focusing too much on empirical success in arguing for the correctness of the current scientific world-view. Instead I argue that one of the major reasons why currently accepted theories should (typically) be taken as true concerns the fact that they enjoy a certain kind of privileged status within scientific communities.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Scientific acceptance; Scientific explanation; Scientific realism; Epistemology; Philosophy of Science; Philosophy; 0422:Philosophy; 0393:Epistemology; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={This dissertation examines the relationship between philosophical assumptions, research methods, and the interpretation of findings in relation to narrative psychology. This discussion joins the longstanding debate regarding the veracity of quantitative and qualitative methods as ways to understand phenomena. Central to this issue are questions regarding the nature of reality, the definition of knowledge, and the nature of the relationship between observer and object. Researchers with a pragmatist philosophy assert that this debate is irrelevant because they believe that an appropriate criterion is whether the methods answer the research question (Blaikie, 2010, pp. 218-226); others disagree and argue that assumptions about the nature of reality shape and constrain all elements of the research process, which then constrains the interpretation of findings (McGrath & Johnson, 2003). This dissertation adopts the latter view. This issue is especially significant for narrative psychology research. Narrative is viewed as a way of knowing and as a way of making sense out of life experiences, so it is fundamentally connected to subjective experience. While many narrative researchers employ qualitative methods to describe subjective narrative accounts, there are others who have applied quantitative methods (e.g., null-hypothesis significance testing) to identify objective principles that can be generalized to larger populations (Lilgendahl & McAdams, 2011; McAdams et al., 2006). This dissertation critically examines Dan McAdams's (1996) methodology to demonstrate that the exclusive use of quantitative analysis for narrative texts imparts a framework for understanding the nature of reality, what knowledge is, and how it is obtained. This influences the types of questions asked as well as the types of information sought in narrative research. This dissertation explores the history of the quantitative and qualitative traditions to identify how the implicit epistemological assumptions within McAdams's framework constrain his methodology. This results in an incomplete understanding of narrative processes because of the limitations of quantitative data. This dissertation proposes modifications to McAdams's framework that will adequately account for the subjective features of narrative processes. This will provide a richer understanding of how interactive narrative processes impact individual lives.},

        abstract={This study sets out to reclaim the ontological epistemology of Saint Thomas Aquinas which serves as a unifier of knowledge in being, within the philosophical milieu of being's forgottenness. Post-Humean and Kantian thought made appearance rather than being solely accessible to the thinking subject. The consequence has been the marginalisation of being as reflected in truth - influenced by scientistic and postmodern paradigms - which has contributed to both the paucity of meaningless metaphysics, and the conceptualisation of science and faith as necessarily opposing categories. To the end of establishing that science and faith have points of intersection, it is argued that the reclamation of Thomist natural philosophy leads to the defence of a clarified form of realism. Establishing the "real" implies that the metaphysical dimensions of the problem of existence can be explored. Within this realist model, the "pre-Modern" Thomistic theory of "scientia" is employed to bring physical and natural science and metaphysics into relationship as components of true knowledge of being. Consequently, the author puts forth that "scientia" is exemplified in, amongst others, the particular science of cosmology since the rudimentary point of engagement between physical and metaphysical science occurs in the act of creation, that is, when being comes into existence. Whilst metaphysics is often disregarded, it is consistently proposed that the causal nature of being demands - by its presence - a more robust account than physical and natural science can offer. The contribution made by this work rests in its ontologically-formed epistemic typology whereby "hard" science and faith are related in boundary areas of knowledge, that is, when metaphysical problems emerge from within physical and natural science. By reimaging "hard" science and reasonable faith within "scientia", both approaches are conceived as adequating to truth when their content is reflective of being.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Causality; Cosmology; Metaphysics; Scholasticism; Thomism; Religion; Philosophy; Philosophy of Science; 0322:Religion; 0402:Philosophy of Science; 0322:Philosophy},

        abstract={Models of memory in cognitive science and philosophy have traditionally explained human remembering in terms of storage and retrieval. This tendency has been entrenched by reliance on computationalist explanations over the course of the twentieth century; even research programs that eschew computationalism in name, or attempt the revision of traditional models, demonstrate tacit commitment to computationalist assumptions. It is assumed that memory must be stored by means of an isomorphic trace, that memory processes must divide into conceptually distinct systems and phases, and that human remembering consists in inner, cognitive processes that are implemented by distinct neural processes. This dissertation draws on recent empirical work, and on philosophical arguments from Ludwig Wittgenstein and others, to demonstrate that this latent computationalism in the study of memory is problematic, and that it can and should be eliminated. Cognitive psychologists studying memory have encountered numerous data in recent decades that belie archival models. In cognitive neuroscience, establishing the neural basis of storage and retrieval processes has proven elusive. A number of revised models on offer in memory science, that have taken these issues into account, fail to sufficiently extricate the archival framework. Several impasses in memory science are products of these underlying computationalist assumptions. Wittgenstein and other philosophers offer a number of arguments against the need for, and the efficacy of, the storage and retrieval of traces in human remembering. A study of these arguments clarifies the ways that these computationalist assumptions are presently impeding the science of memory, and provides ways forward in removing them. We can and should characterize and model human memory without invoking the storage and retrieval of traces. A range of work in connectionism, dynamical systems theory, and recent philosophical accounts of memory demonstrate how the science of memory can proceed without these assumptions, toward non-archival models of remembering.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Psychology; Cognitive processes; Explanatory models; Memory; Memory systems; Memory traces; Wittgenstein; Philosophy of Science; Philosophy; Cognitive psychology; 0422:Philosophy; 0633:Cognitive psychology; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={For more than a decade, the field of bioethics has increasingly turned its attention to wide-ranging discussions of possible future biotechnologies, such as those that might be used to determine the genetic endowments of future offspring or to enhance existing people. Yet while the literature on human biomedical enhancement has become a focal point of bioethical debate, few of the technologies that stimulate this discourse have reached the point where they actually generate the ethical questions that the literature addresses. This study offers a comprehensive analysis and critique of speculative bioethics that builds on existing conceptualizations of two parallel modes of bioethical discourse (prophetic and regulatory), and draws from literature outside of bioethics that examines the social function of expectations regarding future technologies. I begin by tracing various developments in bioethics that have given rise to the enhancement discourse in its present form and survey some of the existing criticism that it has drawn. I demonstrate the ways in which speculative bioethics goes wrong when exploring potential future technologies and scenarios, and evaluate the utility of anticipatory bioethics research that attempts to get ahead of expected future technological developments. In the course of developing a robust theory of the nature and function of the prophetic and regulatory aspects of bioethics, I establish that speculative explorations belong within the domain of the prophetic, not regulatory, mode of bioethics. I expand the critique by examining the roles that technological expectations play in driving both biomedical research as well as public engagement with ethical issues in biomedicine. I argue that many existing ethical explorations of possible future technological scenarios mistakenly identify the object of ethical analysis as the actual possible future. Instead, it is the expectations that drive public discussion and research agendas that are the proper object of scrutiny and analysis. After probing the nature of this shortcoming and its consequences, I enlist alternative approaches that are capable of critically assessing the moral implications of technological expectations themselves. Finally, I develop an integrated approach for exploring the possible future technological scenarios found in speculative bioethics. Drawing on work in narrative ethics and the interface between literature and bioethics, I offer a multifaceted model of `narrative competence,' appropriate for analyzing the existing literature on human enhancement, as well as for pursuing alternatives that could better advance useful modes of bioethical discourse and public deliberation.},

        abstract={Climatology is a paradigmatic complex systems science. Understanding the global climate involves tackling problems in physics, chemistry, economics, and many other disciplines. I argue that complex systems like the global climate are characterized by certain dynamical features that explain how those systems change over time. A complex system's dynamics are shaped by the interaction of many different components operating at many different temporal and spatial scales. Examining the multidisciplinary and holistic methods of climatology can help us better understand the nature of complex systems in general. Questions surrounding climate science can be divided into three rough categories: foundational, methodological, and evaluative questions. "How do we know that we can trust science?" is a paradigmatic foundational question (and a surprisingly difficult one to answer). Because the global climate is so complex, questions like "what makes a system complex?" also fall into this category. There are a number of existing definitions of `complexity,' and while all of them capture some aspects of what makes intuitively complex systems distinctive, none is entirely satisfactory. Most existing accounts of complexity have been developed to work with information-theoretic objects (signals, for instance) rather than the physical and social systems studied by scientists. Dynamical complexity, a concept articulated in detail in the first third of the dissertation, is designed to bridge the gap between the mathematics of contemporary complexity theory (in particular the formalism of "effective complexity" developed by Gell-Mann and Lloyd 2003]) and a more general account of the structure of science generally. Dynamical complexity provides a physical interpretation of the formal tools of mathematical complexity theory, and thus can be used as a framework for thinking about general problems in the philosophy of science, including theories, explanation, and lawhood. Methodological questions include questions about how climate science constructs its models, on what basis we trust those models, and how we might improve those models. In order to answer questions about climate modeling, it's important to understand what climate models look like and how they are constructed. Climate model families are significantly more diverse than are the model families of most other sciences (even sciences that study other complex systems). Existing climate models range from basic models that can be solved on paper to staggeringly complicated models that can only be analyzed using the most advanced supercomputers in the world. I introduce some of the central concepts in climatology by demonstrating how one of the most basic climate models might be constructed. I begin with the assumption that the Earth is a simple featureless blackbody which receives energy from the sun and releases it into space, and show how to model that assumption formally. I then gradually add other factors (e.g. albedo and the greenhouse effect) to the model, and show how each addition brings the model's prediction closer to agreement with observation. After constructing this basic model, I describe the so-called "complexity hierarchy" of the rest of climate models, and argue that the sense of "complexity" used in the climate modeling community is related to dynamical complexity. With a clear understanding of the basics of climate modeling in hand, I then argue that foundational issues discussed early in the dissertation suggest that computation plays an irrevocably central role in climate modeling. "Science by simulation" is essential given the complexity of the global climate, but features of the climate system--the presence of non-linearities, feedback loops, and chaotic dynamics--put principled limits on the effectiveness of computational models. This tension is at the root of the staggering pluralism of the climate model hierarchy, and suggests that such pluralism is here to stay, rather than an artifact of our ignorance. Rather than attempting to converge on a single "best fit" climate model, we ought to embrace the diversity of climate models, and view each as a specialized tool designed to predict and explain a rather narrow range of phenomena. Understanding the climate system as a whole requires examining a number of different models, and correlating their outputs. This is the most significant methodological challenge of climatology. Climatology's role contemporary political discourse raises an unusually high number of evaluative questions for a physical science. The two leading approaches to crafting policy surrounding climate change center on mitigation (i.e. stopping the changes from occurring) and adaptation (making post hoc changes to ameliorate the harm caused by those changes). Crafting an effective socio-political response to the threat of anthropogenic climate change, however, requires us to integrate multiple perspectives and values: the proper response will be just as diverse and pluralistic as the climate models themselves, and will incorporate aspects of both approaches. I conclude by offering some concrete recommendations about how to integrate this value pluralism into our socio-political decision making framework.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Earth sciences; Climate modeling; Complexity; Computation; Philosophy of climate change; Philosophy of science; Systems theory; Climate Change; 0404:Climate Change; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={This dissertation critiques and rejects Elliott Sober's dismissal of intelligent design as a scientific hypothesis. Sober builds the case for this dismissal in chapter 2 of his 2008 book Evidence and Evolution. Sober's case against intelligent design as science is a philosophical one, emerging from a Bayesian likelihood approach. Sober claims that unlike neo-Darwinian processes, intelligent design cannot supply independent evidence to support the claim that it is a measurably likely cause responsible for the emergence of biological organisms and the structures or processes of which they are composed. Without an assessable likelihood, Sober asserts that intelligent design (again, unlike neo-Darwinian mechanisms) is not testable, and since it is not testable, it does not qualify as a scientific hypothesis. This dissertation argues however, that according to Sober's own standards in Evidence, because intelligent design and the neo-Darwinian hypothesis both address unrepeated, major biological changes in the unobservable past, and because they both depend upon crucial analogies in order to support either inductive arguments or likelihood assessments, the two hypotheses stand on equivalent evidential and logical grounds. Either Sober must reject both neo-Darwinism and intelligent design, or he must allow them both as equivalent, rival hypotheses based upon a fair application of his argumentation requirements. In addition, after explaining important basics of analogy theory, and its crucial, even unavoidable role in the historical (or "origins") sciences, the dissertation goes on to show how intelligent design's empirical support, based upon analogy with humanly designed artifacts, machines and increasingly cell-like creations in the laboratory, is continuing to grow stronger by the year in both likelihood and in explanatory power. The dissertation thus concludes that intelligent design should be treated as a viable scientific explanation for the dramatic examples of specified complexity being discovered in biology, and indeed should be regarded as an increasingly vigorous rival to the neo-Darwinian explanation of such complexity.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Analogy; Best explanation; Intelligent design; Likelihood; Neo-darwinism; Science; Philosophy of Science; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={The earth's ecosystems are being quickly degraded by human behaviors. Some ecosystems may soon lose their ability to support human life. As the science of behavior, psychology is obligated to contribute solutions to this problem. Most of the psychological research attempting to explain pro-environmental behavior is sociobehavioral. Sociobehavioral research has led some psychologists to advocate for contextual interventions as the best means for changing behavior. There are three problems with this conclusion. First, sociobehaviorism relies on research methods and explanatory concepts that underperform when applied to the domain of consciousness, leading to skewed data sets and biased conclusions. Second, contextual interventions are much too limited to cope with a problem as large and multifaceted as global environmental degradation. Third, contextual interventions ignore psychology's ethical obligation to increase personal freedom. Environmental degradation is a wicked problem, and wicked problems require a post-normal approach. The philosophy of post-normal science demonstrates that interacting with wicked problems requires the ability to relativize one's own perspective of a problem with a number of other valid interpretations. Wicked problems cannot be solved definitely. High stakes decisions must be made relative to consciously chosen values, not hopes for complete resolution of the problem situation. Constructive developmentalism is suggested as an alternative to sociobehaviorism. It effectively reorients psychology away from changing behavior through contextual intervention while recognizing the larger goal of facilitating capacity to care for self, others, and the natural world. Constructive developmentalism revolutionizes psychology's approach to increasing pro-environmental behaviors, and implies that major changes need to be made should psychology hope to significantly contribute to humanity's collective future. For example, the conceptual structure used by psychology to understand pro-environmental behaviors evolves, proenvironmental behaviors get defined differently, the model of intervention changes, and "solutions" or ideal end states to the problem morph. The new approach signified by constructive developmentalism can safely be conceived of as an evolution or development in thought because it subsumes (transcends and includes) the sociobehavioral emphasis on behavioral or contextual interventions in a wider, more agile framework.},

        abstract={In 1998, Andrew Wakefield and his colleagues published a study in The Lancet that suggested the possibility of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Their suggestion sparked a controversy that persists today, despite numerous studies showing no evidence of a vaccines-autism link. The impact of Wakefield's now-discredited study raises questions about why some audiences find the notion of a vaccines-autism link compelling enough to refuse vaccination and risk the reemergence of once-rare diseases. To better understand the rhetorical dimensions of the controversy, I used generative rhetorical criticism to analyze five book-length artifacts about vaccines and autism. I sought to answer three research questions: (1) Are there significant patterns of argument that emerge among rhetors on different sides of the vaccines-autism controversy? (2) What lessons can be learned about the function of rhetoric in a public controversy about science? (3) What rhetorical strategies might effectively encourage beneficial health behaviors? My findings centered on three major categories: representations of autism, representations of science, and representations of institutions. First, I found that arguments for a vaccines-autism link framed autism in injurious terms that dehumanize autistic persons. Rhetors arguing against a link sometimes attempted to reframe autism as difference rather than disorder, but missed opportunities to challenge the narrative of autism as tragedy. These findings suggested a need for a more humane rhetoric of autism. Second, rhetors on either side of the controversy disagreed about scientific boundaries: what counts as evidence, which publications should be sanctioned by mainstream science, who has the expertise to do scientific work, and what science can and cannot achieve. Rhetors arguing for a vaccines-autism link seemed to misunderstand science's disciplinary boundaries, suggesting a need for educational endeavors that would encourage both scientific and rhetorical literacy. Third, rhetors who argued for a vaccines-autism link expressed suspicion toward institutions, accusing them of ineptitude, malice, and conspiracy. Although rhetors who argued against a link conceded that institutions are capable of and have committed errors, they seek to reaffirm institutional authority. My findings suggest that institutional failures invite defiance, and to address that defiance, institutions must engage in both discourses and actions deserving of trust.}, keywords={Language, literature and linguistics; Philosophy, religion and theology; Communication and the arts; Rhetoric; Rhetoric of Science; Public Health; Vaccine-Autism Controversy; Orthodoxy; Rhetorical Criticism; Philosophy of Science; Technical Communication; 0643:Technical Communication; 0681:Rhetoric; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={In chapter one, I explore various histories of Western science to uncover six common motifs of eighteenth century race science. In chapter two, I explain how this model of race-science was called into question and eventually replaced by another paradigm, a pre-Mendelian and Darwinian evolutionary model. By the mid-to-late nineteenth century, this evolutionary model established an entirely different idea of biological race marked by (a) a processional notion of species, (b) the use of different methods to determine what constitutes a "race" of people, (c) a definition of race based on the struggle for existence and natural selection, (d) morphology as a social sign of the strength or weakness of a race, and as a consequence, (e) the consideration that certain races--or a mixture of races--will contribute to the demise or degeneration of the best form of government. In chapter three, I explain a second epistemic break in scientific race studies, namely, a break from a pre-Mendelian evolutionary framework to one where the meaning of race is conceived from the perspective of the ; and further explicate the rise of a a linguistic-conceptual tendency called eliminativism. In chapter four, I turn to the emergence of a different linguistic-conceptual tendency and vision of melioration, referred to in the literature as retentionism or conservationism. In the final chapter, I offer an alternative to both eliminativism and retentionism by turning to the philosophical pragmatism of William James. I argue that four dynamics of James's thought, i.e., relationalism, radical empiricism/pluralism, pragmatism, and social meliorism are helpful for overcoming the limits of the discursive dilemma between eliminativism and retentionism. I then turn to explain a methodological approach I refer to as pragmatic contextualism. I conclude by examining the social practice of racial profiling and suggest that the value of race discourse ought to be judged by both its ameliorative aims and the social consequences it helps produce.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Race; Pluralism; Pragmatism; Enlightenment; Racism; James, William; Philosophy of science; Philosophy; 0422:Philosophy},

        abstract={The seventeenth century saw radical changes to theories of vision, light, color, matter, and knowledge about animal bodies. Understanding vision in the sixteenth century is essential to grasp these changes, but here many lacunae exist. Histories of vision have focused on mathematical optics and neglected color in natural philosophy and medicine. Historians of medicine have not sufficiently analyzed works on vision and color by physicians. Finally, historians of philosophy have produced few analyses of color theory from antiquity until 1600. My dissertation analyzes two highly important works on vision that have yet to be examined in detail by modern scholars: the natural philosopher Jacopo Zabarella's De visu, first published in his natural philosophy textbook De rebus naturalibus in 1590, and the physician and anatomist Hieronymus Fabricius ab Aquapendente's De visione, first published in 1600. Both taught at the University of Padua, at the time Europe's most prestigious medical school, and their stature and influence was considerable. Chapter 1 provides the history of one widely held theory of what color is and how it arises, which I dub the condensation theory of the origin of color. This theory arises from the Aristotelian commentary tradition with significant influences from astronomy, optics, and anatomy. This theory of color was closely intertwined with an Aristotelian cosmology, and is found in fully developed form in AverroÃ«s. Chapter 2 analyzes book 1 of Zabarella's De visu, where we find the most rigorous and complete explication of this theory in its history. Chapter 3 is an analysis of Fabricius's De visione, which combines anatomy, natural philosophy, and mathematical optics. Chapter 4 examines the shared, novel theory of vision held by Zabarella and Fabricius, and argues that they interacted across disciplinary lines in forming it. Chapter 5 demonstrates Zabarella's and Fabricius's influence on highly important figures for seventeenth-century optics and visual theory, such as Johannes Kepler, FranÃ§ois AguilÃ3n, and Christoph Scheiner; it argues for a revision to current narratives about the reception of the retinal theory of vision; and it addresses some major misconceptions about transformations to theories of vision and sensation in the seventeenth century.},

The knowledge and experience of the key executives of the four nonprofit organizations in the research study of the homeless veteran population made invaluable contributions to the qualitative multiple case study in the field of nonprofit leadership. The findings of the qualitative multiple case study were generally consistent with the existing studies relative to the homeless veteran population. Through the illumination of the thick, rich descriptions of the shared experiences of the nonprofit leaders and manager of the qualitative multiple case study called attention to the linkage with the literature to provide an explanation of the inability of homeless veterans to gain access to certain Veterans Administration services and programs.

        abstract={Marine invertebrate specimens from the ocean floor played a large role in the formation of evolutionary theory and they continued to help men of science adjudicate natural selection later into the nineteenth century. By 1880, the deep ocean floor had become "Darwin's laboratory," a place to test the "direct action of external conditions on organisms." According to dominant Victorian marine biology, the deep sea was an eternal, unchanging biogeographical space. There, and only there, could naturalists investigate how organisms evolved without the influence of changing environmental factors. The ocean floor was also a politically-charged geographical location, as colonial trade networks relied upon accurate mapping of the sea floor to ensure the safety of merchant and naval fleets. This dissertation explores the emergence of the deep-sea floor as a contested space where science, practice, and politics became inextricably linked. One result of that entanglement was a challenge to Darwinian natural selection prompted by marine invertebrate specimens. Governmental and non-governmental organizations from Britain and America joined the battle over natural selection. This story illuminates ways in which the geographical location of an investigation can have long-lasting consequences on international policies, scientific discourse, and biological theories.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Social sciences; Atlantic world; Darwinism; History of evolution; Natural selection; Science practice; Scientific evidence; Philosophy of Science; Science history; 0585:Science history; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={Contemporary neurobiology abounds with multiple experimental protocols and procedures aiming to study identical phenomena. This state of affairs seems to put in jeopardy the integration of experimental results and the extrapolation of laboratory knowledge to natural world phenomena. The problem is further complicated when knowledge produced through animal experimentation is extended to humans. My thesis is that the multiplicity of protocols fosters rather than precludes progress in neurobiology. It is especially valued when the results of different experiments converge. In these cases, the validity of knowledge claims increases. Converging experimental results get integrated. To date, no comprehensive philosophical analysis of animal experimentation in neurobiology exists. For this reason I analyze the functions of animal models in experimental neurobiology. I argue that even though animal models are related to model and experimental organisms, in the case of neurobiology, they are better conceptualized as experimental systems rather than as a subclass of the other two classes of biological models. In a case study, I trace the developments of and the variations on the basic design of Morris water maze experiments to exemplify the motivation for producing variations on basic experimental protocols. Ultimately, I defend a view of the structure of experimental neurobiology which I call optimistic pluralism. It is an extension of the so called perspectival pluralism according to which the integration of multiple partial perspectives employed in the study of any given phenomenon maximizes the knowledge about this phenomenon. It is optimistic because it justifies the possibility for multiple partial perspectives to converge and be integrated in order to provide knowledge about complex phenomena. This view justifies the desirability of multiple experimental protocols in contemporary neurobiology because it values the multiplicity of perspectives they provide.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Biological sciences; Animal models; Calibration; Experiment; Experimental neurobiology; Unity of neuroscience; Validation; Neurosciences; Philosophy of Science; Philosophy; 0422:Philosophy; 0402:Philosophy of Science; 0317:Neurosciences},

        abstract={This dissertation presents an account of the practice of modeling in science in which scientists' perceptual and bodily interactions with external representations take center stage. I argue that modeling is primarily a practice of constructing, manipulating, and analyzing external representations in service of cognitive and epistemic aims of research, and show that this account better captures important aspects of the practice of modeling than accounts currently popular in philosophy of science. Philosophical accounts of the practice of modeling classify models according to the categories of abstract and concrete entities developed in metaphysics. I argue that this type of account obscures the practice of modeling. In particular, using the analysis of the Lotka-Volterra model as an example, I argue that understanding mathematical models as abstract entities--non-spatiotemporally located, imperceptible entities--obscures the fact that the analysis of the Lotka-Volterra model relies primarily on visual perception of external representations, especially hand- or computer-generated graphs. Instead, I suggest that we apply the concepts of internal and external representations, developed in cognitive science, to models, including mathematical models. I then present two case studies that illustrate different aspects of modeling, understood as a practice of constructing, manipulating, and analyzing external representations. First, using Sewall Wright's long-term research on isolation by distance, I articulate the relationship between the uses of a model, the particular aims of research, and the criteria of success relevant to a given use of the model. I argue that uses of the same model can shift over the course of scientists' research in response to shifts in aim and that criteria of success for one use of a model can be different from those for another use of the same model. Second, I argue that in successful scientific research, a scientist uses a model according to the methodological principles of realism and instrumentalism despite the tension that they create among the scientist's uses of the model over time. This thesis is supported by a detailed analysis of successful scientific research done by Seymour Benzer in the 1950s and 60s.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Social sciences; Scientific modeling; Realism; Instrumentalism; Benzer, Seymour; Wright, Sewall; External representation; Philosophy of Science; Science history; 0585:Science history; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={Though the nineteenth-century Victorian belief that science alone could provide utopia for man weakened in the epistemological uncertainty of the postmodern era, this belief still continues today. In order to understand our current scientific milieu--and the dangers of propagating scientism--we must first trace the rise of scientism in the nineteenth-century. Though removed, Fyodor Dostoevsky, in Notes From Underground (1864), and C.S. Lewis, in That Hideous Strength (1965), are united in their critiques of scientism as a conceptual framework for human residency. For Dostoevsky, the Crystal Palace of London's Great Exhibition (1862) embodied the nineteenth-century goal to found utopia through the means of scientific progress. Though the Crystal Palace offers this hope for man, Dostoevsky shows that palace's monological design is ultimately uninhabitable for humans, who are dialogical beings. Writing a century later, Lewis explores the implications of scientism within the National Institute for Coordinated Experiments (otherwise known as the N.I.C.E.), which offers the same conceptual framework as the Crystal Palace. Like Dostoevsky, Lewis exposes the monological myth of scientism and both present hearty critiques of scientism as a way of life for man. They use satire, exaggeration, and wit to show the absurdity of a conceptual framework built on the foundations of a naturalistic philosophy of science.}, keywords={Language, literature and linguistics; Philosophy, religion and theology; Crystal palace; Dostoevsky; Lewis; Naturalism; Philosophy; Science; Literature; Philosophy of Science; Theology; 0401:Literature; 0469:Theology; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={This dissertation is an attempt to understand and assess the presuppositions and methods of classical political science. In the first of its two parts, the dissertation examines the meaning of the traditional view, held by authorities as far removed from one another as Cicero and Hobbes, that Socrates was the founder of political philosophy. It does so by considering the intellectual autobiography that Socrates famously delivers in Plato's Phaedo . Socrates turned to the study of pre-scientific, common-sense moral and political opinions only after he had rejected, as a very young man, both the materialist and the teleological natural science of his philosophic predecessors. It is the task of the dissertation's first part to show how the general revolution in scientific thought presented in the Phaedo , a revolution known as "the Socratic turn," laid the theoretical groundwork for classical political philosophy's characteristic focus on pre-scientific, common-sense moral distinctions. After examining "the Socratic turn," the dissertation then outlines in its second part the approach to the study of politics that Aristotle advanced on the basis of it. In particular, Aristotle's statements on the method of political science in book I of the Ethics are shown to rely on the basic insights obtained through "the turn."}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Social sciences; Causality; Dialectic; Plato; Science; Socrates' second sailing; The socratic turn; Philosophy of Science; Philosophy; Political science; 0615:Political science; 0422:Philosophy; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={My dissertation addresses two longstanding debates in the philosophy of psychiatry: the debate between objectivists and evaluativists regarding the relative significance of factual descriptions and evaluative judgments in attributions of psychiatric disorder and the debate between reductionists and pluralists over whether explanations of psychiatric disorders should proceed at a single level or multiple levels of explanation. The standard way to distinguish philosophical accounts of psychiatric disorder is in terms of the relative significance they grant to factual descriptions of abnormal functioning and evaluative judgments of this abnormal functioning. I argue that this way of categorizing philosophical accounts is overly simplistic and that a more fruitful approach is to focus on the role of epistemic and nonepistemic evaluative judgments in the contexts of psychiatric diagnosis, classification, and research. Using debates regarding the diagnostic criteria for diagnoses of Bipolar Disorder, I highlight the interaction between epistemic and nonepistemic value judgments and argue that the latter play a legitimate role in decisions regarding the relative risks of false positive and false negative diagnoses and whether to draw an inference quickly or wait for further evidence to reduce uncertainties. I show how this approach provides for a more straightforward comparison of the various accounts of psychiatric disorder by making explicit the role and type of evaluative judgments that are either ignored or often tacitly assumed by each account. The second half of my dissertation focuses on the debate between reductionists and pluralists. I outline and evaluate five specific reductionist theses within the philosophy of psychiatry literature: 1) ontological reductionism, 2) eliminative reductionism, 3) methodological reductionism, 4) epistemological reductionism, and 5) causal reductionism. I argue that eliminative, epistemological, and causal reductionism will likely not be borne out by the empirical evidence and that only ontological reductionism, characterized as a general commitment to physicalism, and methodological reductionism are consistent with the current evidence and explanatory aims of psychiatry. I then consider why reductionism has received so much attention and criticism despite the fact that there is no author who explicitly defends the view. I attribute this focus on reductionism to recent proposals to synthesize psychiatry with neuroscience. However, I argue that these proposals advocate nothing more than a general commitment to physicalism and a localized version of methodological reductionism and, therefore, that concerns about reductionist trends in psychiatry and the alleged harms associated with such trends are unwarranted. Pragmatism and pluralism are often defended as alternatives to reductionism in psychiatry. I examine three proposals for incorporating pragmatism into psychiatry and argue that they all fail to provide specific guidance as to how pragmatic considerations should influence decisions regarding psychiatric diagnosis and classification. I then examine proposals for incorporating empirically based pluralism and explanatory pluralism into psychiatry and argue that each view fails to fully address the problem of how to determine the relative explanatory significance of various levels of explanation. I argue that one can only address these shortcomings if one acknowledges a role of nonepistemic value judgments and that the inclusion of such judgments is the inevitable consequence of recognizing the complexity of psychiatric disorders and the provisional nature of psychiatric classification and explanation.},

        abstract={Discussions of the foundations of evolutionary theory - especially natural selection, fitness, and genetic drift - are saturated with terms referring to various kinds of chance, stochasticity, randomness, unpredictability, and so forth. This dissertation examines these uses of chance in philosophical and historical perspective. I begin by arguing that, both in the contemporary and historical arenas, the current state of the literature on chance is deeply troubling. Work in the philosophy of biology (i) often conflates various clearly distinct notions of chance, and (ii) often approaches the analysis of chance from the perspective of a debate (on the causal potency of natural selection and genetic drift) that does not in fact profitability engage evolutionary theory. Historically, as well, the most common way of analyzing the development of the use of chance in evolutionary theory does not engage the actual research of historical actors, a point I make by exploring the work of Karl Pearson and W.F.R.Weldon at the turn of the twentieth century. I thus propose a new guiding question for research into the role of chance in evolutionary theory: what is the relationship between our statistical biological theories and the processes in the world those theories aim to describe? I then offer a novel framework for determining the answer to this question, derived from a deeply biologically-informed understanding of fitness, selection, and drift. This view combines core insights from work in philosophy on the propensity interpretation of fitness with cutting-edge biological treatments of population modeling. Chance enters this model at only a single point - the distribution over the various possible lives that an organism might live - and this single source can explain the influence of chance throughout fitness, natural selection, and genetic drift. This framework, I claim, constitutes a fruitful way to understand both the foundations of evolutionary theory and the role of chance in those foundations.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Social sciences; Chance; Evolution; Evolutionary theory; Fitness; Natural selection; Genetic drift; Philosophy of Science; Science history; 0585:Science history; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={The guiding thought of this dissertation is that phenomenally conscious mental states consist in an appropriate pair of first-order and higher-order representations that are uniquely bound together by mental quotation. In slogan form: to be conscious is to be mentally quoted. Others before me have entertained the idea of mental quotation, but they have done so with the aim of putting mental quotation to work as part of the "phenomenal concept strategy" (Papineau, 2000; Balog, Block, 2006; Balog 2012). Their purpose was importantly different from mine. According to those theorists, mental quotation is entirely introspective. On their views, a mental quotation is supposed to be a unique concept that we sometimes use to think about our own conscious states. Conscious states are assumed to be already conscious in virtue of some independent factor, or factors. Mental quotations are not supposed to be that in virtue of which conscious states are conscious. In contrast, this dissertation proposes that mentally quoting an appropriate first-order state is what makes a conscious state conscious in the first-place. Treating consciousness as existing in a higher-order thought that mentally quotes first-order sensory contents has immediate explanatory dividends. It explains several of the classic puzzles of consciousness as well as solving a set of puzzles to which existing higher-order theorists fail to respond. This includes what many see as an insurmountable problem for existing views: the problem of higher-order misrepresentation. If the higher-order component of a conscious state is quotation-like, the gap is filled between the state represented and the higher-order state that makes the state conscious. Rather than targeting a numerically distinct state from afar, as an extrinsic higher-order representation does, a mental quotation latches onto the very target state itself. The target state is enveloped and thereby becomes a component of the higher-order state, and it is the complex, the quotational state as a whole, that is the conscious state. What emerges from the guiding thought is a novel self-representational (or intrinsic higher-order) model of consciousness, described at the intentional level, which is immune to challenges facing existing views.},

        abstract={This work of comparative literary criticism focuses on the presence of mathematical and scientific concepts and imagery in the works of Italo Calvino and Jorge Luis Borges, beginning with an historical overview of scientific philosophy and an introduction to the most significant scientific concepts of the last several centuries, before shifting to deep, scientifically-driven analyses of numerous individual fictions, and finally concluding with a meditation on the unexpectedly fictive aspects of science and mathematics. The close readings of these authors' fictions are contextualized with thorough explanations of the potential literary implications of theories from physics, mathematics, neuroscience and chaos theory. While the mathematical studies highlight concepts such as "Zeno's Paradox," Cantorian set theory, and representations of numerical infinity, the discussions of physics isolate theoretical structures such as black holes, parallel universes and quantum-entangled particles for use in discussing the fictions of both authors. Underlying the main goals of this work is an equal focus on the existence of an "ideal intellectual" or, more broadly, an ideal liberal arts education that draws together concepts from diverse and seemingly-unrelated fields of knowledge with the intention of generating unexpected and novel ideas and connections. By demonstrating the numerous appearances of scientific and mathematical imagery in the works of Calvino and Borges, this work emphasizes the shared fictive basis of all human knowledge and strives to set science and fiction alongside each other as equals in the hope of preserving the richness and diversity of intellectual enterprises.}, keywords={Language, literature and linguistics; Philosophy, religion and theology; Borges; Calvino; Literary criticism; Literature; Mathematics; Physics; Comparative literature; Latin American literature; Romance literature; Philosophy of Science; 0295:Comparative literature; 0312:Latin American literature; 0402:Philosophy of Science; 0313:Romance literature},

        abstract={In this dissertation I address two related questions pertaining to Aristotle's philosophy of science and his biology and zoology. They are: (1) what are the goals of Aristotle's Historia Animalium (HA) and how does the treatise achieve these goals? And, more generally, (2) what is the role of a historia in Aristotle's philosophy of science? Together these questions touch upon a long recognized problem in the interpretation of Aristotle's philosophical and scientific works related to the relationship between Aristotle's philosophy of science and his actual scientific practice. I pursue this broad question by focusing my attention on Aristotle's historia of animals and the related discussions of scientific investigation and demonstration, primarily in the Analytics . I argue that the term historia was used by Aristotle with a range of meanings that center around the notions of investigation and inquiry (or the reports thereof), and, in some instances, emphasize the early stages of inquiry, dedicated to establishing and organizing facts prior to causal explanation. I proceed by considering the theoretical background of a historia provided by the Analytics and Parts of Animals , before turning to a detailed analysis of select passages from the HA itself. I argue that the Analytics provides the framework for a method of correlating facts regarding a field of study that acts as a guide to further causal research, but that establishing the actual causal relations that hold within a field depends upon additional considerations that are largely domain-specific. I turn to the HA in order to illustrate this method of correlation, noting examples where the correlation of features appears to prefigure causal explanations. I conclude by considering the relationship between Aristotle's notions of historia and experience (empeiria ), and argue that a historia provides the sort of comprehensive, factual knowledge of a domain of study that Aristotle often notes is necessary for coming to recognize causal relations, and thus coming to have scientific knowledge (epistêmê ).}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Aristotle; Historia Animalium; Ancient philosophy; Biology; Zoology; Philosophy of Science; Philosophy; 0422:Philosophy; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={Francis Bacon is one of the architects of the modern conception of scientific method. Yet Bacon's corpus remains little studied and poorly understood. My dissertation is an account of his method with a focus on his reasons for believing that the it enables us to acquire knowledge of the nature of things (i.e., of forms) and thereby to establish causal claims with epistemic certainty. It thus has both an interpretive and an evaluative dimension. By way of a new interpretation of Bacon's method, I defend him against those who have too casually dismissed his aspirations to certainty as a result of their reading him through deductivist or falsificationist lenses. I reconstruct Bacon's method beginning with its foundation in sense-perception. I argue that Bacon (despite his remarks on the faults of the senses, which other interpreters have overemphasized) takes the side of the Epicureans against ancient skeptics. He holds that all sense-perceptions are true, by which he means that they always causally register mind-independent objects. I then argue that Bacon's aspirations for certainty in natural history hinge on his moderate empiricist foundationalism. Part of his account is an original analysis of the self-correcting character of science, according to which erroneous instances in a natural history are eliminated over time as a result of their conflicting with conclusions overwhelmingly supported by the rest of the instances. The guarantee that sporadic errors can be corrected in time is an important element in being able to secure certainty about forms. The culmination of my interpretation is a discussion of Baconian induction, which is usually understood in deductivist terms as a form of eliminative induction. I argue for an alternative interpretation which emphasizes the non-eliminative role of Bacon's prerogative instances. Although the method that I describe should be subjected to further scrutiny, not even Bacon believed that he had the last word to say on scientific methodology; he viewed his method as an inductive discovery which would have to be revised. Accordingly, I offer Bacon's method as a promising approach which contains within itself the resources to further expand its heuristic and justificatory power.},

        abstract={This dissertation offers a revised historical account of how scientific experts associated with the United Nations Education Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in the post-WWII era sought to overcome the legacy of scientific racism. Situating UNESCO's anti-racism initiatives within the geographic context of the South and North Atlantic and the intellectual context of Latin American, Francophone, and Anglo-American social science this study shows that mid-century discussions of 'race' were intertwined with the multiple narratives of modernization and societal change that emerged in tandem with decolonization and the Cold War. Thus, one of this dissertation's key arguments is that anti-racist projects in the post-war era were often cast as projects of redemption that involved coming to terms with the painful and destructive legacy of scientific racism and the anticipation of an improved and harmonious future where 'race' did not figure as a source of conflict and tension. However, because mid-century anti-racist scientists hailed from a variety of cultural, linguistic, and racial backgrounds the question of redemption took on different meanings and involved different stakes. This study examines social science experts' anti-racist narratives of redemption in the context of four different UNESCO initiatives from the 1950s: 1) in projects of 'cultural change' (which were predicated on the anti-racist notion of the inherent educability of all peoples) 2) in UNESCO's study of race relations in various locations in Brazil 3) in the elaboration of anti-racist approaches to ethnographic observation, and 4) in UNESCO attempts to produce anti-racist handbooks for teachers. These projects reveal how anti-racist experts from the 1950s were very much haunted by 'race' and concerned with neutralizing and dampening the affective and political impact of racial conceptions in the geopolitics of post-war era. Thus, this dissertation argues that rather than indicating a definitive retreat from 'race' UNESCO's anti-racism initiatives in the 1950s speak to the persistence and plasticity of 'race' and of the fraught attempts to escape its legacy.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Social sciences; Anti-racism; Race; History of the human sciences; Transnational history; UNESCO; Philosophy of Science; Science history; 0585:Science history; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

Initiating with an establishing European taste paradigm (e.g. Feuerbach, Fourier, Brillat-Savarin), my research demonstrates that there is an increasing number of works composed within the developing "Italian" context, which reflects and participates in the construction and the consumption of a national identity (e.g., Rajberti, Mantegazza, Guerrini, Artusi). Conversely, this budding taste genre finds itself in sharp contrast to the economic paucity and social divisiveness endured by a large sector of the populace and depicted by the literature of the day (e.g., Collodi, Verga, Serao). It is precisely this lack of confluence between that which is scientific and literary that marks this process of taste ennoblement and indoctrination, defining more than ever the nuances that encompass il gusto italiano .}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Social sciences; Italian taste; Italian nationalism; Food and etiquette; Italian literature and cookbooks; National Italian identity; Taste genre; Food philosophy; Cultural anthropology; Philosophy of Science; Aesthetics; 0326:Cultural anthropology; 0650:Aesthetics; 0402:Philosophy of Science}, isbn={9781303843587},

        abstract={Much of biology, especially evolutionary theory, makes assumptions about the individuality of living things. A population, for example, is made up of individuals. Those individuals sometimes reproduce, creating new individuals. The very use of these concepts requires that living individuals can be distinguished both synchronically and diachronically. There are many examples in nature, however, in which a living system is present, but it is not clear how to understand that system's individuality. Plants, fungi, colonial marine invertebrates, insect colonies, and symbiosis are all classic cases that have puzzled biologists interested in understanding their population structure and evolution. Scientific exploration of these issues has connections with traditional philosophical terrain, particularly the ontology of persistence and the nature of individuality broadly construed. A biologically informed philosophical literature has arisen in recent years, aimed at understanding the nature of biological individuality and its role in biological theorizing. My dissertation makes two kinds of contributions to this current literature. One contribution is theoretical, reframing our thinking about biological individuality. I distinguish between two categories of individuality and argue that they play different roles in theorizing about nature. One important kind of individual is that of the organism, understood as an entity that persists through space and time, takes in and processes resources from the environment, and maintains physiological autonomy. Another important kind of individual is that of the evolutionary individual, understood as an entity that has the capacity to participate in processes of natural selection. Distinguishing between these two types of individuality has theoretical utility, keeping clear the distinctive kinds of biological processes that individuals engage in. The other contribution of my dissertation involves detailed natural historical analysis of three kinds of problem cases. Using the framework articulated earlier in the dissertation, I assess the individuality of symbioses between larger organisms and their microbial associates, mushroom-producing fungi, and the classic case of ant colonies. The combined result of the assessments is a hierarchical pluralism about biological individuality.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Individuality; Organismality; Symbiosis; Philosophy of Science; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={The dissertation is an historical and philosophical examination of the epistemology of science in France between 1905 (the year Einstein 1879-1955] published the quartet of papers including the germinal formulation of the special theory of relativity) and 1971 (the year Georges Canguilhem 1901-1995] retired as the director of the Institut d'Histoire des Sciences et des Techniques), dates which I argue bookend the emergence of an epistemological tradition which Dominique Lecourt (1944 -) has dubbed "historical epistemology." I argue that, within this time frame (1905-1971), a methodological consensus emerges within French philosophy according to which the epistemological norms used to evaluate the validity of scientific knowledge must be continually revised in order to account for the historical transformation of scientific concepts and methods. I argue that two consequences proceed from this basic methodological program which have largely escaped critical notice in the Anglo-American and Francophone scholarship devoted to the subject. The first concerns a transformation of the implicit norms guiding epistemological critique. Unlike the Positivist or Neo-Kantian projects of the nineteenth century, the tradition of historical epistemology systematically rejects predetermined theories of the developmental logic of science, on the one hand, (Positivist historiography of science), and the transcendental determination of epistemic normativity on the other (Neo-Kantian Wissenschaftslehre ). The second concerns a transformation of the epistemological status of the history of science itself. The tradition rejects the history of science as a stable configuration, indeed, I argue that a sophisticated historiographical method unites the historical epistemologists in a common project whereby the writing of the history of science becomes a task that must be perpetually renewed. The dissertation has two primary aims. 1) To demonstrate the theoretical consistency of the tradition by determining the nature and function of the normative epistemological commitments which organize its concepts and methodologies, and, in so doing, to contribute to the history of philosophy in twentieth century France and to the history of the philosophy of science. 2) To reconstruct the variable histories of philosophy and of science which the historical epistemologists produce as the result of the epistemological determination of the nature of scientific rationality.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Social sciences; Historical epistemology; History of philosophy; History of science; 20th century France; History of French philosophy; Intellectual history; Philosophy of Science; Philosophy; Science history; 0422:Philosophy; 0585:Science history; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={This project was conducted to measure the influences of individual, social, environmental, and macro political and economic factors on individual decision-making by focusing on the utilization of tobacco cessation services. It relied on the social epidemiological methods and Krieger's Ecosocial theory to describe the multiple levels of factors that influence health behaviors and outcomes. The study sought to contextualize individual behavior by developing and testing a multi-level model of tobacco cessation service usage behaviors. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was conducted to estimate the proportion of variance in cessation service utilization predicted by the influences of individual, social, and neighborhood factors. Individual factors included past smoking behaviors, basic health history, and demographics and background. Contextual factors included social network variables, such as social support and social exposure to smoking behaviors and conditions, and neighborhood variables, including neighborhood disadvantage, neighborhood health status, and tobacco retail density. The investigator collected data from several sources, including from individual surveys, the Washington, DC government data clearinghouse, the Census, and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). These data sources were merged into a multilevel analytic data set using ArcGIS to link geographic information in each data set. HLM findings showed that the following individual factors (respondent's intentions to quit, socioeconomic status, medical trust, pack years, gender, and marital status) and contextual factors (overall social support, social exposure to smoking-related behaviors and illnesses, and tobacco retail density) were important predictors of tobacco cessation service utilization. Individual factors accounted for about 80 percent of the total explained variance in tobacco cessation service utilization across the HLM analyses conducted in this study, and contextual factors accounted for about 20 percent of the explained variance in tobacco cessation service utilization. These results indicate that an individual's context has an important effect on the use of tobacco cessation services. The results may inform future research and interventions on the individual and contextual factors that are most salient in helping people quit smoking.},

        abstract={This dissertation presents an account of the Principle of Simplicity, a prominent idea in the philosophy of science. The principle states that when a simple model and a complex model both predict the data, and all else is equal, the data supports the simpler model more. The account, the "Predictive Focus Account," states that simpler models are better confirmed in these contexts because they make narrower, more focused predictions. The introduction presents Principle of Simplicity and the Predictive Focus Account. It defines key terms and explains the dissertation's methodology. This section also flags background issues that go beyond the scope of the dissertation. Chapter 1 investigates the philosophical history of the Predictive Focus Account, and the relationship between a model's simplicity and its "global likelihood." On this account, the explanation of the advantage of simplicity is grounded in relations of Bayesian confirmation between competing models. That is, the advantage of simplicity is a subtle, but inherent, feature of standard Bayesian model evaluation. This chapter argues that the Predictive Focus Account is incomplete without a method for fixing prior probabilities. It proposes a new approach to fixing objective priors, the "Data Window Prior," grounded in experimental design. The proposed prior bounds the parameters of statistical models and reigns in their predictions, which are a priori unbounded and infinitely extended. So bounded, the models have definite prediction ranges and corresponding degrees of predictive focus. I apply the Data Window Prior to the historical case of Hubble's Law from cosmology, yielding a powerful, intuitive verdict about the confirmation relations between models of varying degree of complexity. Chapter 2 contrasts the Predictive Focus Account with the more popular Bayesian method of "prior-stacking," whereby Bayesians privilege simpler models and hypotheses with higher prior probabilities. The Predictive Focus Account has distinct advantages over the prior-stacking approach: it shows how simplicity can be favored on a posteriori, empirical grounds, and how this favoring relation depends on the nature of the extant data. Chapter 3 contrasts my account with another, based in Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), a contemporary, non-Bayesian alternative. The AIC is a statistical model selection criterion that describes estimation error. It is designed to quantify and resist "over-fitting" the data with complex models. The main advantage of the Predictive Focus Account (and corresponding Bayesian method) is its generality. It applies to a wider range of cases and supports a broader range of inferences than the AIC.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Predictive focus; Simplicity; Bayesian theory; Model selection; Prior probability; Philosophy of Science; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={The aim of this dissertation is essentially twofold: First, to examine the development of the holistic understanding of living nature that stretches from Goethe to Merleau-Ponty, and includes such philosophically-inclined scientists as Kurt Goldstein, Adolf Portmann, and most especially Jakob von Uexküll. Second, to begin constructing a theory of ethical interanimality - that is, a holistic account of the animal that ultimately affirms the ways in which humans and animals are inseparable, ontologically intertwined and bringing forth ever new ways of being in the world. Chapter One argues that radical reductionism in biology fails to adequately consider, among other things, the existence of emergent entities and properties at higher levels of organization. It is suggested that not only does living nature tend towards novelty, but that the organism possesses an inner coherence or meaningfulness, which cannot be satisfactorily grasped as the product of mere chance. Chapter Two develops this theme further by drawing on the work of Goethe, and the science of morphology that he invented as a way of approaching the form of the organism as a whole. The task of morphology is to grasp the living unity and coherence of the organism in its development - that is, diachronically. In Chapter Two, we also find that Goethe anticipates Uexküll, inasmuch as he insists upon viewing the animal holistically, with necessary connections that result in an intrinsically intelligible structure. Chapter Three examines Uexküll's contributions to theoretical biology and biosemiotics: it argues that his Kantianism is excessive; and that the investigation of the animal's surrounding-world does not only inform us as to the functional patternings of the organism, but also tells us something about the essential features of Nature itself. In the final chapter, Chapter Four, we begin rethinking the ethical in terms of an interanimality that recognizes non-human animals as variants of the same sensible-sensing corporeality as humans. In contrast to the traditional hierarchical relation between the human and animal, we follow Merleau-Ponty in proposing a fleshly plane of immanence that becomes recognizable in our comingling and web-like intertwining with non-human others. We are them and they are us.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Emergence; Empathy; Holism; Interanimality; Nature; Umwelt; Ethics; Philosophy of Science; Philosophy; 0394:Ethics; 0422:Philosophy; 0402:Philosophy of Science}, isbn={9781321009347},

        abstract={Scholarship on Sin in Romans 5-8 is plagued by questions about how to understand the vivid personification Paul employs: Are we to conceive of Sin as a real, personal power that menaces the human agent, as a complex social system of human sins, or simply as a literary device that describes a feature of individual human agency? In Romans, Sin is at the very least each of these things. That is, it can appropriately be analyzed at either the individual, the social, or the mythological level. This is clear from "the text itself," and, to a degree, scholars of very different stripes agree about these basic features. The problem is that, while it is agreed that "sin" is described in Romans at each of these levels, no scholar is working with an ontology that permits all these conceptions of s/Sin to coexist. Instead, they find they must privilege one or the other as "reality" and relegate others to the realm of metaphor. Seeking, therefore, a trans-ordinal ontology--an ontology that can make sense of these different "levels" of analysis and their corresponding ontologies--in Chapter 2, I propose we turn to emergentism. In emergentism, we find a description of the world in terms of various "levels." Entities at higher levels emerge from entities at lower levels and yet also exercise "downward causation" back upon these lower-level entities, resulting in causal feedback loops. In Chapter 3, I turn specifically to an emergent account of personhood. On this account, the convoluted causal feedback loops that arise in organisms are what we can most readily describe as "selves," first at the organismic (biological) level and subsequently at the subjective (psychological) level. Biological descriptions of superorganisms and their collective intelligence, alongside sociological accounts of collective "epistemic subjects" and "corporate persons" yield an account of persons at larger scales and higher degrees of abstraction than that of individual persons. This level of emergence I call "mythological" and I propose that Sin be understood as a person emergent at the mythological level. Armed with an emergentist trans-ordinal ontology and a general account of mythological personhood, in Chapter 4 I return to Romans and offer a reading of the Pauline text that understands Sin, the cosmic power, as a person emergent from a complex system of human sins. On such a description, one can maintain at once that Sin enters the world through human transgression (Rom 5) and that, through this exercise of individual human agency, we become members of the superorganismic Body of Sin (Rom 6:6). Sin's constraint of the human agent (Rom 7)--the member of Sin's body--can then be understood as downward causation. This constraint comports with a liberationist phenomenology of the social coercion of Sin, described in terms of Mary Douglas's account of institutional regulation of individuals' moral psychologies. In Chapter 5, I consider that, on Paul's account, not only does Sin have a body, but, in fact, that body is sexed female. It is here that Sin gains the proper name, Hamartia. Hamartia conforms to some of the ancient stereotypes of female physiology--most notably, an enslavement to desire. But she also exercises paradigmatically masculine imperium. In order to understand the significance of Paul's description of Hamartia in these terms, I compare Hamartia to another ancient mythological imperial woman: the goddess Roma. The Body of Christ, I argue, functions as the masculine counterpart to the feminine Body of Sin. But Christ, too, both fulfills and subverts the expectations of the dominant ideology. I conclude Chapter 5 with a discussion of the ethical and theological significance of the multivalence of Paul's engagement with this dominant ideology. Finally, I conclude by outlining a trajectory for a constructive Christian hamartiological project born from this emergent account of Sin. I also describe how my readings of Sin and of Roma provide suggestions for how to understand various complex systems that shape our contemporary globalizing world, especially The Market.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Emergence; Ancient gender ideology; Sin; Hamartiology; Paul; Social ontology; Biblical studies; Philosophy of Science; Theology; 0321:Biblical studies; 0469:Theology; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={The proper role of values in science has been a hotly debated topic for many decades now. The traditional view of epistemic justification holds that scientific objectivity requires suppression of value judgments; theories are only justified by an impartial analysis of the evidence (Haack 1998; Pinnick, Koertge, and Almedar 2003). Traditionalists worry that values bias scientists, leading them to believe what they would like to be true regardless of the evidence. Proponents of value-laden science argue that the justification of scientific theories cannot be isolated from moral and practical judgments (Kuhn 1962; Longino 2002a). The arguments they advance purport to show that values are not merely biases, values can play a positive role in justifying beliefs. Underdetermination arguments claim that evidence alone cannot determine theory choice (Laudan 1990; Longino 1979; Quine 1951).These arguments do not motivate an epistemic role for values in science, however, because values may influence scientists' theoretical beliefs without justifying those beliefs. As a result, philosophers have advanced a number of new arguments for the epistemic necessity of values judgments. This dissertation examines several of these arguments with an eye toward their deficiencies in order to develop an account of values in scientific reasoning that does not legitimate bias or delusion, as the traditionalists fear. Drawing on both old and new arguments, I argue that values help determine when a theory is sufficiently justified by the evidence (Douglas 2000; Kitcher 2011a; Rudner 1953). While evidence alone provides justifying reasons for belief, scientists must decide how much evidence is needed to justify scientific claims. Different scientific inquiries require different epistemic standards and, I argue, traditional value-free epistemologies cannot account for this variation. Philosophers cannot explain why scientists in different contexts adopt different epistemic standards without appealing to value judgments. On the view I adopt, the evidence justifies a claim when we have good reasons to believe we can act on that claim; a theory is sufficiently justified in the epistemic sense when it is sufficiently justified for practical purposes. Allowing values to guide these decisions, I argue, does not allow values to displace rigorous attention to the evidence.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Scientific values; Scientific evidence; Epistemology; Philosophy of Science; 0393:Epistemology; 0402:Philosophy of Science}, isbn={9780499229953},

        abstract={This thesis examines theories of pain in the eighteenth century, and what it meant to sympathize with the pain of another. I begin briefly with the theories of Descartes and his adherents before focusing on David Hartley and John Locke. Physicians and natural philosophers of the period understood pain as a pure mechanism of the nervous system, confined to the tubelike fibers that run through the body. Naturally everyone feels pain by some means, whether illness or injury, so men ought to be able to sympathize with the afflictions of others. Yet, according to Adam Smith in The Theory of Moral Sentiments, this is not so. He argues for the ultimate inexpressibility of pain; our nerves do not mimic the activity of another's nerves, and our reality cannot completely intersect with the reality of another. If sympathy is a shared suffering, pain is impossible to share. Therefore, physical afflictions cannot receive others' sympathies in the same manner as those of the passions, which pass easily between minds. ! ! While the physicians separated the painful operations of the body from the passions and from mind, newly popular sentimental fiction attempted to reunite all three in their work as their authors strove to replicate realistic experiences, expressly fictional or otherwise. Bodily pain and emotional suffering lie on either end of a dialectic, and I propose that the fulcrum sits at inventive semantics that rely on a consciously-created mediator. To demonstrate this, I use the example of Samuel Richardson's Clarissa: or, History of a Young Lady. Richardson assiduously disallows his characters to express real physical pain directly, but frequently uses every linguistic variation of the word "pain" to emphasize emotional and motivational distress rather than bodily harm. Clarissa in particular refuses to say that she experiences any discomfort even when the situation suggests she ought, emphasizing the unimportance of physical substance to her being. Although Richardson's characters undergo all sorts of pains, physical and cognitive, noun and verb, the only ones directly accessible to the reader are the pains of the mind; all that is known of the body comes mediated several times over by the epistles, semantics, and Richardson himself. This essay suggests how novelists incorporate and accommodate these anatomical theories and their relation to the passions rather than repudiate them for the sake of a fabricated subjectivity.}, keywords={Language, literature and linguistics; Philosophy, religion and theology; Adam smith; Clarissa; Mediation; Neuroscience; Pain; Sympathy; Literature; Philosophy of Science; 0401:Literature; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={The psychologist J. J. Gibson, and later the enactivists, espoused a view of perception emphasized active sensory exploration, and the biological functions perception serves. They tended to neglect the internal complexity of perceptual systems. Neuroscientists and computer vision researchers, on the other hand, focus on the complex structure and inner workings of perceptual systems, to the neglect of biological and behavioral context. Here I will formulate a version of ecological realism which reconciles and critiques these seemingly disparate approaches. I argue that the objects of perception are relational invariant structures preserved within the changing flux of perceptual input. The function of perception is to enable appropriate behavior with respect to affordances, which are objective three-way relations between worldly features, animal abilities, and animal needs. The invariant relationships perceived tend to be those which signify affordance relationships for the species and individual in question. The perception-action cycle is but one example of the circular dynamics of perceptual systems. The neural portions of such systems are also in a state of constant feed-forward and feedback dynamical interaction with one another. These dynamics confer an active autonomy on perceptual systems as manifested by phenomena like dreams, hallucinations, and perceptual illusions. Metaphorically, such systems may function to constantly formulate and test hypotheses about affordances based on perceptual evidence and prior categorical experience. Hierarchical predictive models of perception, in which perceptual systems consist of a hierarchy of Bayesian statistical predictors, represent a possible means by which this metaphor might be crafted into a testable scientific hypothesis. Perception, even if it involves actively autonomous perceptual systems coping with ambiguous input, is epistemically reliable most of the time, because it is constantly tested by action. Perceptual states are true or valid if they bear an appropriate relationship to objective affordance relationships, and false or invalid if they do not. These views require a reformulation of the venerable distinction between `direct' and `indirect' perception. Perception is ontologically direct in the sense of dealing in objective relationships in the world, but justificationally indirect in the sense of requiring an argument that perceptual beliefs are generally epistemically reliable.},

        abstract={My dissertation focuses on the problem of matter's divisibility in the 17th -18th centuries. The problem of material divisibility is a focal point at which the metaphysical principle of simplicity and the mathematical principle of space's infinite divisibility conflict. The principle of simplicity is the metaphysical requirement that there must be a simple or indivisible being that is the constitutive foundation of all composite things in nature. Without simple beings, there cannot be composite beings. The mathematical principle of space's infinite divisibility is a staple of Euclidean geometry: space must be divisible into infinitely smaller parts because indivisibles or points cannot compose extension. Without reconciling these metaphysical and mathematical principles, one can call into question the integrity of mathematics and metaphysics. Metaphysical contradiction results from the application of metaphysical simplicity to the composition of material bodies that occupy infinitely divisible space. How can a simple being constitute a material object while occupying a space that lacks a smallest part? Should we assume that a composite material object (such as the paper in front of the reader) exists in an infinitely divisible space, then the simple beings must occupy a space that consists of ever smaller spaces. The simple being thereby appears to consist of parts simpler than itself--a metaphysical contradiction. Philosophers resolve this contradiction by either modifying the metaphysical principle of simplicity to allow for the occupation of infinitely divisible space, or have simply dismissed one principle for the sake of preserving the other principle. The rejection of one principle for preserving the other principle is an undesirable path. Philosophers would either forfeit any attempt to account for the composition of material reality by rejecting simplicity or deny understanding of geometry heretofore via the rejection of space's infinite divisibility. My objective in this dissertation is two-fold: 1.) to provide an historical analysis of various philosophers' attempts to reconcile simplicity and infinite divisibility or to argue for the exclusive nature of the said principles; 2.) to articulate a reconciliation between simplicity and infinite divisibility. Underlying both objectives is my attempt to draw a connection between the metaphysical principle of simplicity and the metaphysical principle of sufficient reason. Having shown in the historical section that each philosopher implicitly references a modified version of the principle of sufficient reason when articulating their theories of metaphysical simplicity, I will use this common principle to develop a Neo-Aristotelian solution to the problem of material divisibility. This Neo-Aristotelian solution differs from other accounts in the historical section by including a potential parts theory of material divisibility while modifying the principle of simplicity: simple beings are no longer conceived as constitutive parts of a material thing, but as the sources of unity for a natural composite being.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Divisibility; Infinity; Mathematics; Matter; Metaphysics; Simplicity; Epistemology; Philosophy of Science; 0396:Metaphysics; 0393:Epistemology; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={In 2002, Fourth Street Missionary Baptist Church in Columbus, GA, began an in-reach ministry called Partners in Christ Caring Ministry (PICCM). This study was designed to determine whether participation in the Partners In Christ Caring Ministry (PICCM) is due to intrinsic, altruistic behavior or whether participation is a result of extrinsic non-altruistic behavior, and whether these behaviors impacted the increase or decline in participation by the congregation in PICCM. The study design included data collected from PICCM members' altruistic behaviors and information regarding the obstacles that impeded members from participating in PICCM. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected to analyze altruistic behavior of individual PICCM members regarding participation. The methodology of the study includes descriptions of participants, ethical considerations. Members of the congregation were invited to be participants in the study. Approximately 200 PICCM members were presented with The Self-Report Altruism Scale. On The Self-Report Altruism Scale, PICCM respondents used a Likert Scale from 1-5 and selected the number that corresponded with the answer that most accurately described how often a particular altruistic behavior was demonstrated. Data were entered in SPSS software. Inferential and descriptive statistics were used to analyze the three research questions. An ANOVA was used to analyze all three research questions regarding the relationship between altruistic behaviors of PICCM members who have high participation in attending PICCM meetings versus PICCM members who have low participation in PICCM. The research failed to reject Null Hypothesis 1 with the exception of two altruistic behaviors regarding helping carry a stranger's belongs. The research failed to reject Null Hypothesis 2 and 3, indicating that there was no significant difference in altruistic behaviors between PICCM members with high participation and PICCM members with low participation. The growth and development of PICCM will be contingent upon the pastor's recommendations based on the fmdings of the research and effectively communicating these recommendations to the leaders of the PICCM ministry.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; PICCM; Partners in Christ Caring Ministry; Partners in Christ; Religion; Philosophy; Philosophy of Science; 0322:Religion; 0402:Philosophy of Science; 0322:Philosophy; 0318:Religion},

My dissertation argues that Hobbes does in fact provide a unified systematic philosophy, and I contrast this unity with problems in Descartes's epistemology and optics. To make this argument, I carve a middle way between the two extremes in the literature by situating Hobbes within mechanical philosophy and 17th century mathematics. I use three concepts to clarify Hobbes's project: mechanical explanation, maker's knowledge, and mixed mathematical science. First, I show that for Hobbes a mechanical explanation involves tracing the motions of bodies at various levels of complexity, from simple points in geometry to human bodies in the state of nature and to commonwealth bodies. This view provides Hobbes with resources for a naturalized epistemology, which I show is the point at issue in Hobbes's Objections to Descartes's Meditations . Second, Hobbes says that we have "maker's knowledge" in geometry and politics. I show that "maker's knowledge" is Hobbes's empiricist answer to (1) how we have causal knowledge in politics and mathematics by constructing and (2) how mathematics is applicable to the world. Finally, I show that the mixed mathematical sciences, e.g., optics, were Hobbes's inspiration for a unified philosophical system. I argue that the physics in De corpore , the optics in De homine , and the politics in Leviathan are treated by Hobbes as mixed mathematical sciences, which provides a new way to see Hobbes as a consistent and non-reductive naturalist. Viewed in this light, the Leviathan turns out to have more methodological similarities to optics than to geometry.},

        abstract={Modern evolutionary genetics studies evolution as a population-level statistical trend, abstracting away concrete causal interactions among individual organisms. Crucial to this approach are various mathematical formulae, which have formed the core part of evolutionary theory since the Modern Synthesis. The abstract nature of the evolutionary principles, however, has invoked a philosophical skepticism with respect to their causal basis: do they describe causal mechanisms or just phenomenological patterns? The goal of this thesis is to identify and extend the causal foundations of evolutionary models using causal graph theory. It first derives the standard evolutionary formulae, such as the breeder's equation and Lande's equation, from causal models representing selection and reproduction. The explicit definition of the underlying causal structures establishes adaptive evolution as a bona fide causal process, where selection and fitness are both causes of evolutionary response. The second part extends this result in order to address complex evolutionary phenomena not covered by the standard models, such as development (which is defined as inter-phenotypic causal networks), epigenetic inheritance, and niche construction. The extensions will be accomplished by way of introducing formal methods to discover causal relationships from observational data, as well as deriving new mathematical formulae that incorporate the identified causal pathways into the prediction of evolutionary response. Through these analyses the present thesis proposes a unifying framework that systematically translates any form of "proximate" causal assumptions into "ultimate" evolutionary dynamics. The final chapter gives a formal characterization of this new framework and explores its implications for the study of evolution.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Biological sciences; Causal models; Developmental evolution; Evolutionary genetics; Natural selection; Price equation; Philosophy of Science; Evolution and Development; 0412:Evolution and Development; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={This dissertation examined clergy leadership in the midst of the Iowa and Presbyterian Church (USA) conflict over same-gender marriage. Reflective of Presbyterian Church (USA) and other literature, the presumption was that clergy embrace conflict as part of a priestly role that encourages realm of God values of diversity, inclusion, and reconciliation. Clergy experience routine conflict, and often it can be destructive. Clergy exercise power in words and other symbols in order to fulfill the priestly role. To explore the clergy use of power as priests, discourse analysis of interviews with them was conducted. Documents submitted by clergy were also submitted to discourse analysis, as were the physical arrangements in which clergy function. Leadership theory, positioning theory, and a philosophy-physics termed agential realism provided the underlying theoretical foundation for the dissertation. Among the conclusions were the verification of clergy dislike of conflict and neglect of the denominational vision of the realm of God; the effectiveness of positioning theory's positioning diamond as an analytical tool; and the need to rethink theological education in light of first, the clergy calling to priestly service in ubiquitous conflict, and second, clergy success being measured in light of Jesus' prioritization of the realm of God over church institutional concerns.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Social sciences; Psychology; Positioning Theory; Quantum Mechanics; Leadership; Conflict; Religion; Church; Philosophy of Science; Social psychology; Organization Theory; 0635:Organization Theory; 0402:Philosophy of Science; 0451:Social psychology},

        abstract={This interdisciplinary dissertation in statistics, economics, and social science methodology derives a methodological approach for economics from philosophical principles, identifies barriers to its adoption, and presents tools and methods for overcoming those barriers. It addresses aspects of inquiry often treated in the discipline of statistics. The dissertation takes a process philosophy approach encompassing aspects of classical pragmatism and documents the influence of this problem solving philosophy on Original Institutionalism and its support for a link between Post Keynesian economics and Original Institutionalism. Contributions are motivated through two case studies. The statistical methods used for policy persuasion in the first case study, in community economics, contrast with the econometric approach and its philosophical and theoretical foundations. The second case study, a contribution to modern statistical theory focusing on alternatives to model selection, reveals the importance of computational thinking and the institutional adjustments the discipline of statistics carried out in embracing that. The dissertation compares and contrasts a ceremonial and instrumental role of mathematical rhetoric in the history of economic thought and methodology and closes with a Moore Method inspired course as a practical start for revising the economics curriculum to reclaim the Keynesian-Institutionalist tradition addressing emerging needs in the discipline as a whole and to train students in the instrumental methodological approach here derived.},

        abstract={The celebrated philosopher-physicist Pierre Duhem appears to maintain virtually contradictory views. On the one hand, he claims that science does not aim to explain natural phenomena, where he assumes that an "explanation" strives to reveal the natural world underpinnings hiding "behind the veil" of observable phenomena. Despite these strong disavowals, he also insists that successful scientific theories should converge on "natural classifications" which allegedly provide "hints concerning the true affinities of things." But won't such relationships also lie "behind the veil"? These warring inclinations have created significant exegetical confusions, leading his interpreters to classify him as an antirealist, a realist and everything else in between. Duhem is clearly trying to get across some important methodological lesson about science. But what is it? The trick is to align his philosophy more closely with the forms of physics he endorses. On this basis, I argue that Duhem's disavowals of "explanation" actually represent arguments against a dynamic laws picture of science: the doctrine that science must seek laws that track material systems according to the basic patterns of D-N explanation. He argues that many of natures most important hidden quantities (e.g., entropy and potential energy) were not discovered in a dynamical manner but were instead uncovered by stringing together relationships in the quasi-static manner employed in thermodynamics. Indeed, it is the deep relationships of the latter subject of the latter subject that supply paradigms of the "natural classifications" that Duhem seeks. Once one follows through the details of his recommendations, employing concrete scientific examples, one realizes that Duhem's reflections on the scientific method greatly enlarge our appreciation of what the many varieties of "good science" can look like. This challenges many dogmatic presumptions about the scientific methodology that still prevail in contemporary philosophy of science.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Philosophy of science; Duhem, pierre; Variational principles; Scientific realism; Metaphysics; Classical mechanics; Philosophy; 0396:Metaphysics; 0422:Philosophy; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={Comparative cognition is the interdisciplinary field of animal cognition and behavior studies, which includes comparative psychology and branches of ethology, biology, and neuroscience. My dissertation shows that the quasi-epistemic value of parsimony plays a problematic role in the experimental setting of comparative cognition. More specifically, I argue that an idiosyncratic interpretation of the statistical hypothesis-testing method, known as the Neyman-Pearson Method (NPM), embeds an Occamist parsimony preference into experimental methodology in comparative cognition, which results in an underattribution bias, or a bias in favor of allegedly simple cognitive ontologies. I trace this parsimony preference to the content of the null hypothesis within the NPM, and defend a strategy for modifying the NPM to guard against the underattribution bias. I recommend adopting an evidence-driven strategy for choosing the null hypothesis. Further, I suggest a role for non-empirical values, such as ethical concerns, in the weighting of Type I and Type II error-rates. I contend that statistical models are deeply embedded in experimental practice and are not value-free. These models provide an often overlooked door through which values, both epistemic and non-epistemic, can enter scientific research. Since statistical models generally, and the NPM in particular, play a role in a wide variety of scientific disciplines, this dissertation can also be seen as a case study illustrating the importance of attending to the choice a particular statistical model. This conclusion suggests that various philosophical investigations of scientific practice--from inquiry into the nature of scientific evidence to analysis of the role of values in science--would be greatly enriched by increased attention to experimental methodology, including the choice and interpretation of statistical models.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Animal cognition; Experiment; Null hypothesis; Parsimony; Statistics; Philosophy of Science; Philosophy; 0422:Philosophy; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={The current consensus view of causation in physics, as commonly held by scientists and philosophers, has several serious problems. It fails to provide an epistemology for the causal knowledge that it claims physics to possess; it is inapplicable in a prominent area of physics (classical thermodynamics); and it is difficult to reconcile with our everyday use of causal concepts and claims. In this dissertation, I use historical examples and philosophical arguments to show that the interventionist account of causation constitutes a promising alternative for a "physically respectable" account of causation. The interventionist account explicates important parts of the experimental practice of physics and important aspects of the ways in which physical theory is used and applied. Moreover, the interventionist account succeeds where the consensus view of causation in physics fails. I argue that the interventionist account provides an epistemology of causal knowledge in physics that is rooted in experiment. On the interventionist view, there is a close link between experiment and the testing of causal claims. I give several examples of experiments from the early history of thermodynamics that scientists used in interventionist-type arguments. I also argue that interventionist claims made in the context of a physical theory can be epistemically justified by reference to the experimental interventions and observations that serve as evidence for the theory. I then show that the interventionist account of causation is well-suited to the patterns of reasoning that are intrinsic to thermodynamic theory. I argue that interventionist reasoning constitutes the structural foundation of thermodynamic theory, and that thermodynamic theory can provide clear answers to meaningful questions about whether or not a certain variable is a cause of another in a given context. Finally, I argue that the interventionist account offers the prospect of a unification of "physically respectable" causation and our everyday notion of causation. I conclude the dissertation by sketching an anti-foundationalist unification of causation, according to which causal reasoning occurs in the same manner in physics as it does in other branches of life and scientific research.},

        abstract={In this dissertation I argue that the framework under which epistemology operates should be broadened to account for developments in cognitive science that indicate that a good deal of cognition and reasoning involves the use of non-linguistic representations. In chapter 1, I argue that, although epistemology is the theory of knowledge, epistemologists generally operate as though their field is simply the theory of propositional knowledge. Epistemologists generally assume that knowledge is a certain type of belief relation to a true proposition. However, cognitive science indicates that many of our mental representations are not belief-like at all, and thereby, not belief relations to propositions. Rather, the mind employs representations that take the form of images, scale models, activation patterns, and so on. I call this claim representational pluralism. If some of these non-linguistic representations are constitutive of knowledge, as I argue that they are in later chapters, then this requires a substantial revision of the traditional epistemological framework. I proceed to introduce some potential consequences of departing from the propositional knowledge tradition in epistemology. These consequences pertain most directly to two issues, namely, philosophical methodology and our understanding of normative standards of rationality. In chapter 2 I discuss knowledge-how, a type of knowledge that many have argued is non-propositional. In the first part of the chapter I discuss two intellectualist positions, that is, positions that hold that know-how is propositional. Stanley and Williamson argue that propositional knowledge is both necessary and sufficient for know-how, while Bengson and Moffett argue that propositional knowledge is not sufficient, but is necessary, for know-how. In chapter 3 I argue that epistemology's failure to take representational pluralism seriously has skewed the field's understanding of normative standards of rationality. I discuss two ways in which epistemology's normative standards of rationality are limited. First, they apply only to agents with purely linguistic or belief-like cognitive systems. Second, they apply only to cognitive systems that are capable of meeting them, due to what I call the ought-can principle. In chapter 4, I examine the role that knowledge plays in two domains: everyday life and the institution of science. In everyday contexts, I argue that knowledge plays a warrant-granting role for action. This way of thinking about knowledge has drawn some attention in the epistemology literature from Keith DeRose, Jason Stanley, John Hawthorne, and Jeremy Fantl and Matthew McGrath, amongst others. However, I argue that none of these "pragmatic encroachment" approaches draw the correct connection between knowledge and practical affairs. In particular, many of these accounts are designed to be supplements to more traditional, independent accounts of knowledge. In chapter 5, I present summaries of the preceding chapters. I then conclude that epistemology, in order to be the theory of knowledge, rather than the theory of propositional knowledge, must become more pluralistic. This is not to say that we need to abandon studies of propositional knowledge. But rather, epistemology as a field should become more fragmented, specialized, and connected to scientific accounts of the mind and cognition.

        abstract={This thesis provides the first empirical explanatory theory for community authorization for Genetically Modified Mosquito (GMM) trials. Although this theory was developed in the context of GMM trials, it can apply to other endeavors, research or not, where whole communities might be affected. As GMM make their way from laboratories to villages of developing countries to test their effectiveness in controlling vector-borne diseases, community authorization emerges as a critical and urgent, yet undefined, mechanism of protection and respect for communities who might be affected by research and its outcomes. Following a constructivist Grounded Theory approach, I analyzed three prominent GMM trials from Mexico, the Cayman Islands, and Malaysia. Nineteen (19) interviews and two hundred and forty nine (249) documents were analyzed in order to uncover the substantive and procedural aspects of authentic and sufficient community authorization for research, as well as the factors that affect such authorization. This interdisciplinary bioethics thesis supports a relational notion of community authorization, as a continuous state of ongoing, maintenance-dependent, approval for research from inception through all stages. Enabled by successful relationships between researchers and community groups and individuals, this state manifests in formal and informal ways at all levels of the community; institutional, national, regional, local, and even individual, and involves authorities, both official and traditional, and publics alike. The state of authorization manifests in reciprocity, or the fulfillment of commitment to promote mutual interests. The findings challenge current conceptions of research participants as well as consent, and consequently current practices of research appraisal. Future research is needed to provide researchers, research ethics boards, and regulatory agencies with standardized tools to gauge the conduct of research in relationship to the community. The elements of this theory, as well as its reliability, applicability and generalizability, need to be tested and refined in future empirical work in multiple contexts and different fields.},

        abstract={Criminology has enfolded a number of outliers into its paradigm(s) over the past 100 years. Most momentous was absorption of the mathematical form through the wide-spread adoption of statistics that had been developed throughout the 19th Century. While the infusion of statistics has resulted in an expansive growth of knowledge and solidified the criminologist's place within academia, it has led to a muddling of theory. Most detrimental, application of the mathematical form led to the binary treatment of theory that resultantly led to the segregation of theory, both in regards to the separation of theories from one another and the expulsion and isolation of theoretical bodies from normative criminology, in general. Currently all historical and contemporary criminological theory is housed within either one of two mutually exclusive paradigmatic spheres as argued by Ruth Kornhauser (1978): "social-disorganization" theory/paradigm, which encapsulates control and strain theories, or "cultural-deviance" theory/paradigm, which encapsulates all cultural theories. These disparate paradigms are distinguished by various competing underlying assumptions that cannot be merged (1978; Hirschi, 1979), thereby they represent binary opposites of one another. It will be argued that this eventually led to criminological theory either being "right" or "wrong" and if it is one, it cannot be the other. Acting as a sort of "outlier machine," this has led to the effective cleaving from the field of criminology a number of "wrong" conceptualizations/theories. Because of the binary treatment of theory, large amounts of information are effectively cleaved from a field's paradigmatic sphere and thereby become "outliers". Criminological outliers are essentially a result of picking and choosing "right" theory while simultaneously displacing "wrong" theory. To cure this dilemma a theoretical model should be developed. The end result of this dissertation is to rebuild the theoretical machine of criminology, thereby constructing a unified theoretical model of criminological theory capable of withstanding the inclusion of outliers and thereby bridging criminology's two competing paradigms. The model that will be constructed to repair the outlier machine assumes that the use of binary, such as the distinction between competing assumptions undergirding the criminological paradigm, is both inappropriate and injurious.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Social sciences; Multifarious; Outliers; Paradigm; Philosophy; Theoretical model; Theory; Philosophy of Science; Criminology; 0627:Criminology; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

I develop a relational thesis in which ecology and evolutionary biology are understood as mutually demarcating, since they emerge from transpositional patterns of relations amidst a shared constellation of fundamental concepts of stability and change. This proposal is derived from a consideration of two research avenues in the philosophy of biology. The first concerns the relatively young field of the philosophy of ecology, and in particular the attempts by some of its principal investigators to give a general account of the science. The second research context concerns the philosophy of biology more generally, and the acknowledged need for a better understanding of the relationship between ecology and evolutionary biology. The relational thesis is derived from insights obtained through a comparative analysis of certain key aspects of ecology and evolutionary biology. These key contexts include a reexamination of Charles Darwin's conception of the struggle for existence and its relation to natural selection, Stephen Forbes progenitorial researches in limnology and community ecology, the development of the concept of competitive exclusion both in the care of G.

        abstract={This dissertation explores the megamachine, a prominent metaphor in American humanist and philosopher of technology, Lewis Mumford's Myth of the Machine series. The term refers critically to dynamic, regimented human capacities that drive scientific and technical innovation in society. Mumford's view of the nature of collectives focuses on qualities and patterns that emerge from the behavior of groups, societies, systems, and ecologies. It is my aim to reenergize key concepts about collective capacities drawn from Lewis Mumford's critique of historical and modern sociotechnical arrangements. I investigate the possibility of accessing those capacities through improved design for Technology Assessment (TA), formal practices that engage experts and lay citizens in the evaluation of complex scientific and technical issues. I analyze the components of Mumford's megamachine and align key concerns in two pivotal works that characterize the impact of collective capacities on society: Bruno Latour's Pasteurization of France (1988) and Elias Canetti's Crowds and Power (1962). As I create a model of collective capacities in the sociotechnical according to the parameters of Mumford's megamachine, I rehabilitate two established ideas about the behavior of crowds and about the undue influence of technological systems on human behavior. I depart from Mumford's tactics and those of Canetti and Latour and propose a novel focus for STS on "sociotechnical crowds" as a meaningful unit of social measure. I make clear that Mumford's critique of the sociotechnical status quo still informs the conditions for innovation today. Using mixed mode qualitative methods in two types of empirical field studies, I then investigate how a focus on the characteristics and components of collective human capacities in sociotechnical systems can affect the design and performance of TA. I propose a new model of TA, Emergent Technology Assessment (ETA), which includes greater public participation and recognizes the interrelationship among experience, affect and the material in mediating the innovation process. The resulting model -- the "soft" megamachine --introduces new strategies to build capacity for responsible innovation in society.},

        abstract={The Internet, in Brian Trench's (2008) words, "is turning science communication inside-out" and, as a result, the boundaries between internal and external science communication are "eroding." Yet these boundaries have long been complicated by "para-scientific genres" such as trade magazines, as Sarah Kaplan and Joanna Radin (2011) show, when they detail genres that exist "alongside" mainstream scientific genres. These genres' existence is dependent upon their association with established scientific media and genres, such as the scholarly journal and the scientific research article. Moreover, these genres reach a wider audience, including policymakers and others involved in the community, with a mission of influencing the direction of a discipline or field. Bringing together these ideas, Carolyn R. Miller and I (forthcoming) extend the notion of parascientific genres to account for emerging genres of science communication online, suggesting that the rhetorical work parascientific genres do has been partially moved into more public (or, external) spheres of scientific discourse. This dissertation focuses on the erosion of boundaries between internal and external science communication to explore the possibilities for parascientific genres--and looks specifically to citizen science as a site of inquiry. While some attention has been paid to citizen science, it is often devoted to scientist-driven cases, where discursive acts are governed by rhetorics of professionalized science. Participant-driven citizen science can depart from these conventions, I maintain. And interesting examples of parascientific genres, or genres that demonstrate characteristics of both internal and external science communication, are available for examination. In this study, I trace the history of this distinction between expert and public science communication, looking back to early scientists, amateur scientists, and forward to the emerging trends in citizen science. I also uncover an emerging sphere, both within and beyond citizen science, where hackers have become involved in scientific research. I trace this phenomenon to the emergence of "hackerspaces." I then take up Safecast as a case study to suggest that boundaries between expert and public spheres of science communication are eroding. Securing funding and support for Safecast's work--collecting radiation readings--relied on the use of "parascientific genres." I suggest that emerging "parascientific" genres--genres alongside traditional scientific genres--demonstrate features characteristic of both expert and public scientific communication. To better understand this phenomenon, I employ rhetorical genre theory and stylistic analysis in a comparative analysis. I compare traditional scientific genres (grant proposals, conference talks, and scientific databases) to what I believe are parascientific genres. The parascientific genres I analyze are science-focused Kickstarter funding proposals, conference talks, and Safecast's database. This study helps to address questions about the relationship between expert and public science communication as well as professional and amateur communication of scientific and technical subject matter.}, keywords={Language, literature and linguistics; Philosophy, religion and theology; Communication and the arts; Rhetoric of science; Science studies; Genre studies; Genre theory; Rhetorical theory; Citizen science; Philosophy of Science; Technical Communication; Rhetoric; 0643:Technical Communication; 0681:Rhetoric; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={During the 1960s, the long-standing idea that traits or behaviors could be explained by natural selection acting on traits that persisted "for the good of the group" prompted a series of debates about group-level selection and the effectiveness with which natural selection could act at or across multiple levels of biological organization. For some this topic remains contentious, while others consider the debate settled, even while disagreeing about when and how resolution occurred, raising the question: "Why have these debates continued?" Here I explore the biology, history, and philosophy of the possibility of natural selection operating at levels of biological organization other than the organism by focusing on debates about group-level selection that have occurred since the 1960s. In particular, I use experimental, historical, and synthetic methods to review how the debates have changed, and whether different uses of the same words and concepts can lead to different interpretations of the same experimental data. I begin with the results of a group-selection experiment I conducted using the parasitoid wasp Nasonia, and discuss how the interpretation depends on how one conceives of and defines a "group." Then I review the history of the group selection controversy and argue that this history is best interpreted as multiple, interrelated debates rather than a single continuous debate. Furthermore, I show how the aspects of these debates that have changed the most are related to theoretical content and empirical data, while disputes related to methods remain largely unchanged. Synthesizing this material, I distinguish four different "approaches" to the study of multilevel selection based on the questions and methods used by researchers, and I use the results of the Nasonia experiment to discuss how each approach can lead to different interpretations of the same experimental data. I argue that this realization can help to explain why debates about group and multilevel selection have persisted for nearly sixty years. Finally, the conclusions of this dissertation apply beyond evolutionary biology by providing an illustration of how key concepts can change over time, and how failing to appreciate this fact can lead to ongoing controversy within a scientific field.},

        abstract={This dissertation responds to the belligerence, hesitance, indifference, and wonder that has intensified over the last three decades towards the interdisciplinary study of literature and science. Since the nineteenth century, spectral metaphors have given shape to narratives of interdisciplinary tension, informing a history worried by horror stories of Cartesian mechanization, posthuman disembodiment, and academic hostilities. In answer, this dissertation engages the feminist technoscience and posthuman feminist theories of interdisciplinary scholars, including Gillian Beer, George Levine, and N. Katherine Hayles, and re-examines the narratives and metaphors of nineteenth-century Britain which consummate readings of mechanism and meaning. The goal is not to encourage reiterations of the ghost as a figure of interrupted disciplines, as others have established, but to re-examine the specter as an interstitial structure constellating the many speculative associations that welcome bold explorations between science and literature. Thus this dissertation reappropriates the specter as a harbinger of propitious interdisciplinarity. To this end, my arguments locate the philosophy-physics of Newtonian, entropic, and chaotic science in the diegetic margins of subjective experience in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818), Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights (1847), and Henry James's The Turn of the Screw (1898). In addition to the hybrid structure of the epistolary novel, I examine the spectrality (e.g. monstrosity, elusiveness, promise, and desire) of metaphors, including those of multiformed bodies, light, absence, and reflections. In this way, this dissertation pursues the épistèmic changes from matter- and motion- to energy- and information-based ontoepistemologies and traces an evolution of the nineteenth-century epistolary novel in its advancement alongside the sciences as both begin to comprehend a more indeterminate and probabilistic universe, simultaneously immense, vacuous, and wondrous beyond the rigidity of mimetic narrative. These analyses find meaning in human narrative as part of that nature which, like science, art seeks to understand and, in the end, reconnect nineteenth-century British literature not just with the scientific discourses of the period but with the increasingly technoscientific and ecocritical culture of the twenty-first century.}, keywords={Language, literature and linguistics; Philosophy, religion and theology; Chaos; Epistolary novels; Newtonian science; Nineteenth-century literature; Thermodynamics; Philosophy of Science; British and Irish literature; 0593:British and Irish literature; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

The theory was intended to be a grand theory, where particularities of people's communication experience were seen as instances of what the theory indicates.

By taking together the general theory and special theory, a holistic model of human communication was developed, in which an interpenetrating relation between interpersonal and organizational communication was revealed.

        abstract={Is there an early developing neuro-cognitive structure that is specific to our moral sense? Recent research has begun to explore this question using a classic thought experiment known as the trolley problem. These "trolley studies" have uncovered what appears to be a universal pattern of moral intuitions in adults that some argue can only be explained by assuming implicit knowledge of complex moral principles. In this dissertation, I build on this work by testing preschoolers' and adults' tacit knowledge of the principle of double effect - a principle that has a long history within the fields of philosophy, religion, and law, and which has recently been proposed to underlie our moral intuitions in the trolley problem. I also investigate the role of perceived ingroup/outgroup structure in moral judgment - a factor which others have hypothesized to be a foundation of moral judgment. Across three studies, preschoolers (studies 1 and 2) and adults (study 3) were tested on a series of dilemmas that were similar in structure to the traditional trolley problems, but involved property violations and assault (i.e. the apprehension of bodily harm) rather than "personal" violations such as battery or homicide. In all three studies, participants showed a strong and stable pattern of intuitions consistent with the principle of double effect: dilemmas in which an individual was harmed as a foreseen side effect of saving five people were judged favorably, but dilemmas in which an individual was intentionally harmed as a means to saving five people were judged unfavorably. Four-year-olds and adults (but not three-year-olds) also disapproved of scenarios in which an agent knowingly allowed a preventable harm to occur. Manipulations of minimal ingroup/outgroup structure had little to no effect on either preschoolers' or adults' moral judgments in these dilemmas. Implications for the structure and development of moral judgment are discussed.},

        abstract={The critical aim of this dissertation is to show the lack of explanatory value of typological generalizations in generative research paradigms, and the constructive aim is to propose an alternative conception of typology which gives a justifiable place to typological facts. My contention is that we cannot conclude that the human language faculty (HLF) lacks the means to generate a linguistic phenomenon from only the lack of such a phenomenon in the languages of the world. The temptation to do so arises from equivocation regarding the term Language as used within different generative paradigms: the classical generative paradigm, and the generative-parametric paradigm. The former characterizes Language, understood as HLF, the mental object which allows us to produce and understand languages. For the latter, however, Language also includes the distribution of linguistic structures in the world. HLF is a natural kind; the distribution of linguistic structures in the world is not. Equivocation of the term 'Language' occurs when one notion is exchanged for the other within an argument. The problem: only natural kinds support induction. The goal of characterizing HLF is discovering what is necessarily true of HLF. The distribution of linguistic phenomena in the world, although constrained by what HLF allows us to acquire, is also constrained by historical contingency. Generalizations based on these accidental factors are valueless in characterizing HLF: I show this in two case studies, which deal with syllable structure and verbal morpheme order. I argue that the study of the distribution of linguistic phenomena in the world is a historical science, which requires a different set of assumptions than an experimental science such as the classical generative paradigm. The alternative I offer is called ideal-typology. Ideal-typology replaces inductive inference based on natural kinds with pragmatic explanation based on "ideal-types". Ideal-types are convenient fictions, purpose-built to manipulate our cognitive systems into understanding the diversity of historical-scientific data. I illustrate the practice of ideal-typology by showing how the diversity of Chinese tone systems can be measured and organized by the use of ideal-types. Beyond increasing understanding of the data themselves, ideal-typology yields hypotheses that experimental sciences can test.}, keywords={Language, literature and linguistics; Philosophy, religion and theology; Tone; Human language faculty; Chinese; Linguistics; Philosophy of science; Typology; Verbal agreement; Epistemology; 0290:Linguistics; 0393:Epistemology},

        abstract={In this paper I set out to problematize what the distinguished evolutionary biologist, Edward O. Wilson, has presented to a popular audience as his consilience worldview. Wilson's consilience worldview is a metaphysical framework that presumes the existence of an underlying unity in the knowledge gleaned from otherwise diverse modes of intellectual inquiry, and details a particular normative approach for its discovery by scientists. After introducing Wilson's consilience worldview (WCW), I review philosophical and historical literature on the role that values play in scientific inquiry and explain how to understand WCW as a problematic bundle of prescriptive claims concerning the appropriate doing of scientific inquiry. Specifically, I examine deleterious implications for the study of human social behavior that result from attempted application of WCW in order to challenge Wilson's claim that WCW is the most profitable or promising research program to adopt in the study of human social behavior (what I describe as the `The Fertility Objection'). Then, I present an argument for why readers of Consilience should regard its central thesis, WCW, skeptically, as potentially deleterious to the process and aims of science (what I describe as the `The Scientific Integrity Objection').},

        abstract={Scientists often construct simplified and idealized models in order to study complex phenomena. Yet they do not model a phenomenon in its entirety but target only the aspects of the phenomenon which they consider relevant. Hence, the model is said to describe the target system and not the whole phenomenon. The term `target system' has become popular in the philosophy of science, yet most authors do not provide a definition or analysis of the concept. The result is that the term is used ambiguously, which has undermined its potential value and usefulness for scientific practice. The aim of this dissertation is to provide a cogent account of target systems and their importance in science, with examples taken from case studies in ecology. The central issue I explore in my dissertation concerns the nature of target systems. What are target systems? How are they specified? How can they be evaluated? In my dissertation I give an account of target systems as real parts of systems in the world, which are specified through a process of partitioning and abstraction. I also provide a tentative theory of target system evaluation based on the notion of aptness for a particular scientific purpose. A deep understanding of nature and function of targets can resolve problems in science. I use the term `target system analysis', to denote the specification of target systems of one enquiry and the comparison of targets across enquiries. The last part of the dissertation is devoted to the application of the theory of target system specification and evaluation to a case study from actual scientific practice, invasion biology. Target system reveals that a scientist constructing a unificatory framework in invasion biology faces a tradeoff between generality and predictability. A truly unified framework must incorporate a multitude of different causes of invasion, yet the causes of each invasion are unique. Hence, invasion biology can have a unified theory, based on the process of invasion, yet this theory will be of little use to predicting particular invasions.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Biological sciences; Ecology; Modeling; Target system; Biology; Philosophy of Science; 0329:Ecology; 0306:Biology; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={Throughout history, there has been an ongoing debate concerning which theories and practices should, in principle, be identified as science as opposed to being demarcated as either non-science or pseudoscience. The first part of my thesis will investigate the positions held by Karl Popper, Thomas Kuhn, Larry Laudan and Imre Lakatos in regards to drawing the line of demarcation between science and non-science. An analysis of their positions will buttress my final conclusion that there should not be a definitive line drawn amongst the two. Rather, we should accept that the demarcating line between science and pseudoscience is fuzzy at best. If a definitive line is to be drawn, dire medical and ethical consequences would result. Part 2 of my thesis addresses facts and values in science. Because the argument concerning the description of science is as old as science itself, I found it imperative to distinguish between facts and values. This debate, of course, intensifies when scientists are accused of the value-ladeness of their theories. Making a claim such as this invokes controversy, as science is typified by objective methods. I argue that to claim that science is value-laden is to reduce it to a subjective enterprise. My aim is to demonstrate that historically, scientific objectivity has increasingly influenced value-not the adverse.},

        abstract={Many contemporary philosophers are drawn to a doctrine of causal fundamentalism. This doctrine has its epistemic and its metaphysical tenets. The epistemic tenet holds that causation is to be investigated primarily by looking to the ground-floor level of reality. The metaphysical tenet of causal fundamentalism maintains that, once the causal structure of the fundamental level of reality is settled--once, that is, we know which fundamental physical events cause which other fundamental physical events--all of the world's causal structure is settled. This could either be because the fundamental causal structure is the only causal structure that there is to settle, or it could be because all other causal structure that there is in some sense reduces to that found at the fundamental physical level. The first part of the dissertation disputes both tenets of causal fundamentalism. Chapter 1 argues against the methodology of attempting to locate causation within the theories of fundamental physics without engaging in conceptual analysis. Chapter 2 argues that the world comes equipped with novel and irreducible causal structure at higher levels of description. Settling the world's fundamental causal structure does not suffice to settle all of the world's causal structure. Importantly, accepting this thesis does not commit us to the view that there are irreducible higher-level laws, or irreducible higher-level properties; it is entirely consistent with the view that all facts reduce to fundamental physical facts. The second part of the dissertation takes up the task of constructing an anti-fundamentalist theory of causation. On this theory, the causal relata are the events of parts of the world acquiring or retaining properties. In order for two events to be causally related, one must counterfactually depend upon the other, or else there must be a certain kind of chain of counterfactual dependence leading from the one to the other. This theory is broadly in the spirit of Lewis's 1973 counterfactual account of causation. Yet it is able to escape the numerous counterexamples which led even Lewis to eventually abandon that theory.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Causation; Counterfactuals; Emergence; Structural equations; Philosophy of Science; Philosophy; 0422:Philosophy; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

        abstract={This dissertation investigates microbes in the human gut as objects around which scientific and anthropological imperatives are emerging. Commensal bacteria are material and biological, alive and lively, agentive and constitutive of the majority of genes and cells in the human body. By commensal I mean the microbes that have co-evolved with humans for one hundred thousand years, and without which we could not digest food, fight infection, or live. What does it mean to think of human bodies as mostly microbial? In recent years metagenomic sequencing technology has provided new ways of seeing commensal bacteria in the human body, and these new scientific perspectives are revealing the impact indigenous microbes have on human health. What is at stake in these newly understood human-microbe relationships? Microbes are being enacted through cutting-edge science, sequencing and bioinformatic technologies, global public health programs, and probiotic interventions. Studies of microbes necessitate a micro-view reorientation to concepts of ecology, geography, nutrition, and data; a critical proximity to the details of micro-objects as well as attention to the macro-processes within which they are implicated. I argue that human/microbial relationships elide categories of the biological and social, self and other, individual and community. Based on fourteen months of fieldwork at The Gordon Lab at Washington University, where new gut microbe findings and research directions are emerging, I investigated the microbial conditions through which social scientists and human microbial ecologists are rethinking communities, interactions and environments; shifting analyses of life from entities to processes. Specifically, I followed commensal bacteria in the human gut as it traveled between the field (maternal and child nutritional intervention in Bangladesh) and the lab (microbial genomics and diet experiments). Scientists are evaluating how food, environment, and genes affect human gut microbes, and how those microbes in turn affect human health, illness, and evolution. Commensal microbes are transmitted and cultivated between humans through biological as well as social, intimate practices--such as feeding, affection, and birth. By accounting for microbes, and through interdisciplinary collaborations in the study of microbes, natural and social scientists can work toward co-accountable, ethical, and effective scientific practices.}, keywords={Philosophy, religion and theology; Social sciences; Commensal bacteria; Ethnography; Global health; Gut microbes; Cultural anthropology; Philosophy of Science; 0326:Cultural anthropology; 0402:Philosophy of Science},

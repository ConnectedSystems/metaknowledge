In superconducting magnetic energy storage, increasing the stored energy also increases the electromagnetic force, which generally requires heavier support structure. In terms of the force applied to conductors, it causes the extra bending and/or torsional strain of the REBCO tapes. To minimize the applied stress and to reduce the amount of electromagnetic force support structures, a force-balanced coil (FBC) that has a helical-like structure has been proposed. In this type of magnets, the superconducting thin tape experiences complex strains that come from flatwise and edgewise bending and tensile stress before coil operation. It is necessary to assess the applied strain distribution on the YBCO layer to fabricate an FBC. A newly developed experimental device to apply various strains to the tape and evaluate the strain distributions is presented. The results show that localized large strain will degrade the overall superconducting property. © 2016 IEEE.","complex bending; force-balanced coil; SMES; strain distribution; YBCO","Carbon; Carbon footprint; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Ground supports; High temperature applications; High temperature superconductors; Magnetic storage; Superconducting magnets; Superconducting materials; Yttrium barium copper oxides; Electromagnetic forces; Experimental devices; Force-balanced coils; SMES; Strain distributions; Superconducting magnetic energy storages; Superconducting properties; YBCO; Strain",,,,,,"Barth, C., Electro-mechanical properties of REBCO coated conductors from various industrial manufacturers at 77 K, self-field and 4.2 K, 19 T (2015) Supercond.

How does a social sphere inform regulation and, more specifically, how can the regulatory capacity of a social sphere be harnessed, as an alternative or significant complementary force to state regulation and reliance on the self-regulatory capacity of markets? This question is salient and topical also in light of the search for new regulatory strategies and perspectives in the aftermath of the 2007 financial and subsequent EU sovereign debt crises, which have led to a major realignment of economy and society in a number of countries. This introduction argues that economic sociology is a crucial reference point for understanding more about the social practices that constitute business behavior. It enables to explore the scope and significance of often interlinked social and legal norms for regulating various transnational risks that economic activity can give rise to. The introduction therefore locates the quest for understanding more about the regulatory capacity of a social sphere in debates that draw on Karl Polanyi's analysis of the embedding, disembedding, and re-embedding of economic activity into social norms. The introduction highlights one of the key themes developed in this special issue, the idea of society within economy which questions an assumed conceptual distinction between economy and society. This introduction concludes by specifying how the accounts of risk regulation developed in this special issue chart a path that is different from recent explorations of the role of a social sphere in regulation, which were conducted under the banner of ""the sociological citizen,"" ""regulatory sociability,"" and ""collaborative governance."" © 2013 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Economic sociology of law; Financial crisis; Karl Polanyi; Regulation; Social sphere; Transnational risk",,,,,,,,"Lange, B.; Centre for Socio-Legal Studies, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom","Lange B.Thomas D.Sarat A.",,,,,,,10594337,9781781907382,,,"English","Stud.

Secrets are defined as bits of information that, for one reason or another, are kept hidden or controlled so as to elude attention, observation or comprehension. Three conceptual lenses - the micro-analytic focusing on self-deception, the social-psychological focusing on self-disclosure, and the macro-analytic focusing on public secrets - are probed. Secrecy at each of the three levels is revealed to be a janusfaced issue providing undeniable benefits to Homo sapiens in their efforts to adapt to a changing world yet also creates undeniable problems. While secrecy provides the occasion for the demonstration of loyalty and intimacy, it also generates the conditions for exclusion and betrayal. The contemporary impulse to create public forums in which all is revealed, in which 'sunlight' prevails, is too simple a panacea to those who use the topic of secrecy as an occasion to correct social, political and economic problems. © 1987 D.

The authors develop a marketing capability framework which can be used as a qualitative tool for examining the “state-of-the-art” of marketing in small manufacturing companies.

Neglect of this topic is especially unfortunate, given that exploratory analysis of federal district court judges' decision making in an urban context has suggested a link between federal district court policies and those of other local government institutions (Dolbeare, 1969). This article begins to fill the research lacuna by examining the impact of local environments on federal district courts' economic policy making. Substantial variance in economic case outcomes among courts in cities serving as district court points is explained by certain characteristics of the courts' social and political environments. Patterns of support for business in the district courts is examined to illustrate possible consequences of environmental influences on trial court outcomes. Conclusions regarding the impact of environmental factors on district court policy outcomes are offered along with a comparison of this research with the larger and more developed body of state and local policy research. © 1986.",,,,,,,,"Barker, (1983) Financing State and Local Economic Development, , Duke University: Council of State Planning Agencies; Bryant, The Dimensions of Reformism in Urban Policy Analysis (1976) Urban Affairs Review, 12, pp. 117-124; Carp, Rowland, (1983) The Politics of District Court Policy Making, , University of Tennessee Press, Knoxville, TN; Carp, Wheeler, Sink or Swim: The Socialization of a Federal District Judge (1972) Journal of Public Law, 21, p. 359; Chase, (1972) Federal Judges: The Appointing Process, , University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis; Cook, Sentencing Behavior of Federal Judges: Draft Cases—1972 (1973) University of Cincinnati Law Review, 42, pp. 563-597; Cook, Public Opinion and Federal Judicial Policy (1977) American Journal of Political Science, 21, pp. 567-600; Dolbeare, (1967) Trial Courts in Urban Politics, , Wiley, New York; Dolbeare, The Federal District Courts and Urban Public Policy (1969) Frontiers of Judicial Research, pp. 373-404. , Joel B.

This virus, estimated to kill up to a half of those infected, has spread to more than 1 million Americans. There is no safe and effective treatment. Nor is there a vaccine. From our understanding of HIV transmission, further spread of the virus can be stopped by the use of various techniques. The combined use of education-motivation-skill building, serologic screening, and contact tracing/notification could eliminate or substantially reduce transmission. To accomplish this reduction an immense concerted effort by physicians, public health practitioners, business, and community organizations is required to get across the simple prevention messages. Those messages are: (1) Any sexual intercourse (outside of mutually monogamous or HIV antibody-negative relationships) must be protected with a condom. (2) Do not share unsterile needles or syringes. (3) All women who may have been exposed should seek HIV-antibody testing before becoming pregnant and, if positive, avoid pregnancy. Only through a concerted, vigorous, and sustained prevention program that deals frankly with this problem will those individuals at risk be reached and motivated to take personal responsibility to protect themselves. Without such an effort, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome will continue to kill ever-increasing numbers of Americans. © 1987, American Medical Association.

Based on the GLOBOCAN 2008 estimates, about 12.7 million cancer cases and 7.6 million cancer deaths are estimated to have occurred in 2008; of these, 56% of the cases and 64% of the deaths occurred in the economically developing world. Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among females, accounting for 23% of the total cancer cases and 14% of the cancer deaths. Lung cancer is the leading cancer site in males, comprising 17% of the total new cancer cases and 23% of the total cancer deaths. Breast cancer is now also the leading cause of cancer death among females in economically developing countries, a shift from the previous decade during which the most common cause of cancer death was cervical cancer. Further, the mortality burden for lung cancer among females in developing countries is as high as the burden for cervical cancer, with each accounting for 11% of the total female cancer deaths. Although overall cancer incidence rates in the developing world are half those seen in the developed world in both sexes, the overall cancer mortality rates are generally similar. Cancer survival tends to be poorer in developing countries, most likely because of a combination of a late stage at diagnosis and limited access to timely and standard treatment. A substantial proportion of the worldwide burden of cancer could be prevented through the application of existing cancer control knowledge and by implementing programs for tobacco control, vaccination (for liver and cervical cancers), and early detection and treatment, as well as public health campaigns promoting physical activity and a healthier dietary intake. Clinicians, public health professionals, and policy makers can play an active role in accelerating the application of such interventions globally. ©2011 American Cancer Society, Inc.",,"article; bladder cancer; breast cancer; cancer control; cancer epidemiology; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer statistics; cancer survival; colorectal cancer; developing country; esophagus cancer; geographic distribution; human; Kaposi sarcoma; lip cancer; liver cancer; lung cancer; mouth cancer; nasopharynx cancer; nonhodgkin lymphoma; priority journal; risk factor; risk management; stomach cancer; uterine cervix cancer; vaccination; international cooperation; neoplasm; Humans; Internationality; Neoplasms",,,,,,"(2008) The Global Burden of Disease: 2004 Update, , World Health Organization, Geneva: World Health Organization; http://globoeaniarc.fr.2010, Ferlay J, Shin HR, Bray F, Forman D, Mathers CD, Parkin D.

The results are presented here in summary form, including the geographic variation between 20 large ""areas"" of the world. Overall, there were 10.9 million new cases, 6.7 million deaths, and 24.6 million persons alive with cancer (within three years of diagnosis). The most commonly diagnosed cancers are lung (1.35 million), breast (1.15 million), and colorectal (1 million); the most common causes of cancer death are lung cancer (1.18 million deaths), stomach cancer (700,000 deaths), and liver cancer (598,000 deaths). The most prevalent cancer in the world is breast cancer (4.4 million survivors up to 5 years following diagnosis). There are striking variations in the risk of different cancers by geographic area. Most of the international variation is due to exposure to known or suspected risk factors related to lifestyle or environment, and provides a clear challenge to prevention. © American Cancer Society, Inc., 2005.",,"bladder cancer; breast cancer; cancer; cancer diagnosis; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer prevention; cancer research; cancer risk; cancer statistics; cancer survival; cause of death; colorectal cancer; environmental exposure; geographic distribution; Hodgkin disease; human; international cooperation; Kaposi sarcoma; larynx cancer; leukemia; lifestyle; liver cancer; lung cancer; melanoma; myeloma; nasopharynx cancer; nonhodgkin lymphoma; prevalence; priority journal; prostate cancer; review; risk factor; stomach cancer; survival time; testis cancer; thyroid cancer; uterine cervix cancer; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Epidemiologic Studies; Female; Geography; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Infant, Newborn; International Cooperation; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Prevalence; Risk Factors; World Health",,,,,,"Parkin, D.M., Stjernswörd, J., Muir, C.S., Estimates of the worldwide frequency of twelve major cancers (1984) Bull.

The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list - reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the ""tumor microenvironment."" Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",,"angiogenesis inhibitor; telomerase; transforming growth factor beta; angiogenesis; autophagy; bone marrow; cancer cell; cancer growth; cancer invasion; cancer stem cell; cell death; cell growth; cell immortalization; cell proliferation; cell survival; endothelium cell; energy metabolism; enzyme activation; fibroblast; genetic variability; genomic instability; human; inflammation; inflammatory cell; metastasis; mutational analysis; neoplasm; nonhuman; pericyte; plasticity; priority journal; review; senescence; somatic cell; tumor immunity; tumor microenvironment; tumor vascularization; Animals; Genomic Instability; Humans; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasms; Signal Transduction; Stromal Cells",,,,,,"Adams, J.M., Cory, S., The Bcl-2 apoptotic switch in cancer development and therapy (2007) Oncogene, 26 (9), pp. 1324-1337. , DOI 10.1038/sj.onc.1210220, PII 1210220; Aguirre-Ghiso, J.A., Models, mechanisms and clinical evidence for cancer dormancy (2007) Nature Reviews Cancer, 7 (11), pp. 834-846. , DOI 10.1038/nrc2256, PII NRC2256; Ahmed, Z., Bicknell, R., Angiogenic signalling pathways (2009) Methods Mol.

S., Redhill, United Kingdom","Anticancer cytotoxic agents go through a process by which their antitumor activity - on the basis of the amount of tumor shrinkage they could generate - has been investigated. In the late 1970s, the International Union Against Cancer and the World Health Organization introduced specific criteria for the codification of tumor response evaluation. In 1994, several organizations involved in clinical research combined forces to tackle the review of these criteria on the basis of the experience and knowledge acquired since then. After several years of intensive discussions, a new set of guidelines is ready that will supersede the former criteria. In parallel to this initiative, one of the participating groups developed a model by which response rates could be derived from unidimensional measurement of tumor lesions instead of the usual bidimensional approach. This new concept has been largely validated by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Group and integrated into the present guidelines. This special article also provides some philosophic background to clarify the various purposes of response evaluation. It proposes a model by which a combined assessment of all existing lesions, characterized by target lesions (to be measured) and nontarget lesions, is used to extrapolate an overall response to treatment. Methods of assessing tumor lesions are better codified, briefly within the guidelines and in more detail in Appendix I. All other aspects of response evaluation have been discussed, reviewed, and amended whenever appropriate.",,"antineoplastic agent; cytotoxic agent; article; clinical practice; clinical trial; computer assisted tomography; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; history of medicine; human; human cell; human tissue; intermethod comparison; international cooperation; phase 3 clinical trial; practice guideline; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; solid tumor; Antineoplastic Agents; Clinical Trials; Disease-Free Survival; Endoscopy; Humans; Neoplasms; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Tumor Markers, Biological",,"Antineoplastic Agents; Tumor Markers, Biological",,,,"Zubrod, C.G., Schneiderman, S.M., Frei E.

Design: Estrogen plus progestin component of the Women's Health Initiative, a randomized controlled primary prevention trial (planned duration, 8.5 years) in which 16 608 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years with an intact uterus at baseline were recruited by 40 US clinical centers in 1993-1998. Interventions: Participants received conjugated equine estrogens, 0.625 mg/d, plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mg/d, in 1 tablet (n=8506) or placebo (n =8102). Main Outcomes Measures: The primary outcome was coronary heart disease (CHD) (nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A global index summarizing the balance of risks and benefits included the 2 primary outcomes plus stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, and death due to other causes. Results: On May 31, 2002, after a mean of 5.2 years of follow-up, the data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the trial of estrogen plus progestin vs placebo because the test statistic for invasive breast cancer exceeded the stopping boundary for this adverse effect and the global index statistic supported risks exceeding benefits. This report includes data on the major clinical outcomes through April 30, 2002. Estimated hazard ratios (HRs) (nominal 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were as follows: CHD, 1.29 (1.02-1.63) with 286 cases; breast cancer, 1.26 (1.00-1.59) with 290 cases; stroke, 1.41 (1.07-1.85) with 212 cases; PE, 2.13 (1.39-3.25) with 101 cases; colorectal cancer, 0.63 (0.43-0.92) with 112 cases; endometrial cancer, 0.83 (0.47-1.47) with 47 cases; hip fracture, 0.66 (0.45-0.98) with 106 cases; and death due to other causes, 0.92 (0.74-1.14) with 331 cases. Corresponding HRs (nominal 95% CIs) for composite outcomes were 1.22 (1.09-1.36) for total cardiovascular disease (arterial and venous disease), 1.03 (0.90-1.17) for total cancer, 0.76 (0.69-0.85) for combined fractures, 0.98 (0.82-1.18) for total mortality, and 1.15 (1.03-1.28) for the global index. Absolute excess risks per 10000 person-years attributable to estrogen plus progestin were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 8 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while absolute risk reductions per 10 000 person-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. The absolute excess risk of events included in the global index was 19 per 10 000 person-years. Conclusions: Overall health risks exceeded benefits from use of combined estrogen plus progestin for an average 5.2-year follow-up among healthy postmenopausal US women. All-cause mortality was not affected during the trial. The risk-benefit profile found in this trial is not consistent with the requirements for a viable intervention for primary prevention of chronic diseases, and the results indicate that this regimen should not be initiated or continued for primary prevention of CHD.",,"conjugated estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate;

Its morphological features suggest that it is an active, inherently programmed phenomenon, and it has been shown that it can be initiated or inhibited by a variety of environmental stimuli, both physiological and pathological. The structural changes take place in two discrete stages. The first comprises nuclear and cytoplasmic condensation and breaking up of the cell into a number ol membrane-bound, ultrastructurally well-preserved fragments. In the second stage these apoptotic bodies are shed from epithelial-lined surfaces or are taken up by other cells, where they undergo a series of changes resembling in vitro autolysis within phagosomes, and are rapidly degraded by lysosomal enzymes derived from the ingesting cells. Apoptosis seems to be involved in cell turnover in many healthy adult tissues and is responsible for focal elimination of cells during normal embryonic development. It occurs spontaneously in untreated malignant neoplasms, and participates in at least some types of therapeutically induced tumour regression. It is implicated in both physiological involution and atrophy of various tissues and organs. It can also be triggered by noxious agents, both in the embryo and adult animal. © 1972, Cancer Research Campaign.

Drug therapy for hypercholesterolaemia has remained controversial mainly because of insufficient clinical trial evidence for improved survival. The present trial was designed to evaluate the effect of cholesterol lowering with simvastatin on mortality and morbidity in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). 4444 patients with angina pectoris or previous myocardial infarction and serum cholesterol 5·5-8·0 mmol/L on a lipid-lowering diet were randomised to double-blind treatment with simvastatin or placebo. Over the 5·4 years median follow-up period, simvastatin produced mean changes in total cholesterol, low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol of -25%, -35%, and +8%, respectively, with few adverse effects. 256 patients (12%) in the placebo group died, compared with 182 (8%) in the simvastatin group. The relative risk of death in the simvastatin group was 0·70 (95% Cl 0·58-0·85, p=0·0003). The 6-year· probabilities of survival in the placebo and simvastatin groups were 87·6% and 91·3%, respectively. There were 189 coronary deaths in the placebo group and 111 in the simvastatin group (relative risk 0·58, 95% Cl 0·46-0·73), while noncardiovascular causes accounted for 49 and 46 deaths, respectively. 622 patients (28%) in the placebo group and 431 (19%) in the simvastatin group had one or more major coronary events. The relative risk was 0·66 (95% Cl 0·59-0·75, p<0·00001), and the respective probabilities of escaping such events were 70·5% and 79·6%. This risk was also significantly reduced in subgroups consisting of women and patients of both sexes aged 60 or more. Other benefits of treatment included a 37% reduction (p<0·00001) in the risk of undergoing myocardial revascularisation procedures.

Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard million population. A total of 1,529,560 new cancer cases and 569,490 deaths from cancer are projected to occur in the United States in 2010. Overall cancer incidence rates decreased in the most recent time period in both men (1.3% per year from 2000 to 2006) and women (0.5% per year from 1998 to 2006), largely due to decreases in the 3 major cancer sites in men (lung, prostate, and colon and rectum [colorectum]) and 2 major cancer sites in women (breast and colorectum). This decrease occurred in all racial/ethnic groups in both men and women with the exception of American Indian/Alaska Native women, in whom rates were stable. Among men, death rates for all races combined decreased by 21.0% between 1990 and 2006, with decreases in lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer rates accounting for nearly 80% of the total decrease. Among women, overall cancer death rates between 1991 and 2006 decreased by 12.3%, with decreases in breast and colorectal cancer rates accounting for 60% of the total decrease. The reduction in the overall cancer death rates translates to the avoidance of approximately 767,000 deaths from cancer over the 16-year period. This report also examines cancer incidence, mortality, and survival by site, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and calendar year. Although progress has been made in reducing incidence and mortality rates and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in persons younger than 85 years. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population and by supporting new discoveries in cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment. © 2010 American Cancer Society, Inc.",,"age distribution; article; breast cancer; cancer incidence; cancer localization; cancer mortality; cancer registry; cancer staging; cancer statistics; cancer survival; childhood cancer; colon cancer; ethnic difference; ethnicity; geographic distribution; human; lung cancer; priority journal; prostate cancer; rectum cancer; sex ratio; survival rate; United States; adolescent; adult; aged; child; ethnology; female; incidence; infant; male; middle aged; mortality; neoplasm; preschool child; probability; time; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Probability; Survival Rate; Time Factors; United States",,,,,,"(1930) Public-use Data File; 2005-2007, , National Center for Health Statistics, Division of Vital Statistics, Center for Disease Control, special-use data file; (2009) SEER Cancer Statistics Review, 1975-2006, , Horner M, Ries L, Krapcho M, et al, eds., Bethesda, MD: National Cancer Institute; SEER*Stat Database: Incidence- SEER 17 (2008) Regs Public Use, , www.seer.cancer.gov, Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program, Nov, Sub (2000-2006)-Linked to County Attributes- Total US, 1969-2006 Counties.

Overall cancer incidence rates decreased in the most recent time period in both men (1.8% per year from 2001 to 2005) and women (0.6% per year from 1998 to 2005), largely because of decreases in the three major cancer sites in men (lung, prostate, and colon and rectum [colorectum]) and in two major cancer sites in women (breast and colorectum). Overall cancer death rates decreased in men by 19.2% between 1990 and 2005, with decreases in lung (37%), prostate (24%), and colorectal (17%) cancer rates accounting for nearly 80% of the total decrease. Among women, overall cancer death rates between 1991 and 2005 decreased by 11.4%, with decreases in breast (37%) and colorectal (24%) cancer rates accounting for 60% of the total decrease. The reduction in the overall cancer death rates has resulted in the avoidance of about 650,000 deaths from cancer over the 15-year period. This report also examines cancer incidence, mortality, and survival by site, sex, race/ethnicity, education, geographic area, and calendar year. Although progress has been made in reducing incidence and mortality rates and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in persons younger than 85 years of age. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population and by supporting new discoveries in cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment. ©2009 American Cancer Society, Inc.",,"prostate specific antigen; adolescent; adult; age distribution; aged; article; breast cancer; cancer control; cancer diagnosis; cancer epidemiology; cancer growth; cancer incidence; cancer localization; cancer mortality; cancer prevention; cancer registry; cancer screening; cancer statistics; cancer survival; cause of death; child; colon cancer; colorectal cancer; controlled study; demography; education; ethnicity; female; heart disease; human; infant; laboratory test; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; mammography; national health organization; neoplasm; non profit organization; North America; preschool child; priority journal; prostate cancer; public health service; race; rectum cancer; school child; sex ratio; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Ethnic Groups; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Registries; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Survival Analysis; United States; Young Adult",,,,,,"Centers for Disease Control, , http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/deaths.htm, National Center for Health Statistics, Division of Vital Statistics, Available at:, Accessed April 20, 2009; Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program.

In this article, we present the results for 20 world regions, summarizing the global patterns for the eight most common cancers. Overall, an estimated 12.7 million new cancer cases and 7.6 million cancer deaths occur in 2008, with 56% of new cancer cases and 63% of the cancer deaths occurring in the less developed regions of the world. The most commonly diagnosed cancers worldwide are lung (1.61 million, 12.7% of the total), breast (1.38 million, 10.9%) and colorectal cancers (1.23 million, 9.7%). The most common causes of cancer death are lung cancer (1.38 million, 18.2% of the total), stomach cancer (738,000 deaths, 9.7%) and liver cancer (696,000 deaths, 9.2%). Cancer is neither rare anywhere in the world, nor mainly confined to high-resource countries. Striking differences in the patterns of cancer from region to region are observed. © 2010 UICC.","Cancer; Global estimates; Incidence; Mortality","accuracy; adolescent; adult; aged; article; breast cancer; cancer epidemiology; cancer incidence; cancer localization; cancer mortality; cancer survival; cause of death; child; colorectal cancer; developed country; developing country; esophagus cancer; female; geographic distribution; groups by age; human; infant; liver cancer; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; neoplasm; newborn; prediction; preschool child; priority journal; prostate cancer; school child; sex ratio; stomach cancer; uterine cervix cancer; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Prognosis; Registries; Risk Factors; Survival Rate; Time Factors; World Health; Young Adult",,,,,,"Parkin, D.M., The evolution of the population-based cancer registry (2006) Nat Rev Cancer, 6, pp. 603-12; (2002) National Cancer Control Programmes.

Here, a generic approach to cancer classification based on gene expression monitoring by DNA microarrays is described and applied to human acute leukemias as a test case. A class discovery procedure automatically discovered the distinction between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) without previous knowledge of these classes. An automatically derived class predictor was able to determine the class of new leukemia cases. The results demonstrate the feasibility of cancer classification based solely on gene expression monitoring and suggest a general strategy for discovering and predicting cancer classes for other types of cancer, independent of previous biological knowledge.",,"acute granulocytic leukemia; acute leukemia; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; article; cancer classification; cancer genetics; gene expression; human; prediction; priority journal; Acute Disease; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Cell Adhesion; Cell Cycle; Gene Expression Profiling; Homeodomain Proteins; Humans; Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Acute; Leukemia, Myeloid; Neoplasm Proteins; Neoplasms; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Oncogenes; Predictive Value of Tests; Reproducibility of Results; Treatment Outcome",,"homeobox protein HOXA9; Homeodomain Proteins; Neoplasm Proteins",,,,"Triche, T.J., (1988) Prog.

A total of 1,638,910 new cancer cases and 577,190 deaths from cancer are projected to occur in the United States in 2012. During the most recent 5 years for which there are data (2004-2008), overall cancer incidence rates declined slightly in men (by 0.6% per year) and were stable in women, while cancer death rates decreased by 1.8% per year in men and by 1.6% per year in women. Over the past 10 years of available data (1999-2008), cancer death rates have declined by more than 1% per year in men and women of every racial/ethnic group with the exception of American Indians/Alaska Natives, among whom rates have remained stable. The most rapid declines in death rates occurred among African American and Hispanic men (2.4% and 2.3% per year, respectively). Death rates continue to decline for all 4 major cancer sites (lung, colorectum, breast, and prostate), with lung cancer accounting for almost 40% of the total decline in men and breast cancer accounting for 34% of the total decline in women. The reduction in overall cancer death rates since 1990 in men and 1991 in women translates to the avoidance of about 1,024,400 deaths from cancer. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population, with an emphasis on those groups in the lowest socioeconomic bracket.

School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, United States","Human breast tumours are diverse in their natural history and in their responsiveness to treatments. Variation in transcriptional programs accounts for much of the biological diversity of human cells and tumours. In each cell, signal transduction and regulatory systems transduce information from the cell's identity to its environmental status, thereby controlling the level of expression of every gene in the genome. Here we have characterized variation in gene expression patterns in a set of 65 surgical specimens of human breast tuours from 42 different individuals, using complementary DNA microarrays representing 8,102 human genes. These patterns provided a distinctive molecular portrait of each tumour. Twenty of the tumours were sampled twice, before and after a 16-week course of doxorubicin chemotherapy, and two tumours were paired with a lymph node metastasis from the same patient. Gene expression patterns in two tumour samples from the same individual were almost always more similar to each other than either was to any other sample. Sets of co-expressed genes were identified for which variation in messenger RNA levels could be related to specific features of physiological variation. The tumours could be classified into subtypes distinguished by pervasive differences in their gene expression patterns.",,"doxorubicin; article; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cancer genetics; gene expression; genetic transcription; human; human tissue; molecular genetics; priority journal; signal transduction; Breast Neoplasms; DNA, Neoplasm; Female; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Genes, erbB-2; Humans; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Phenotype; Tumor Cells, Cultured",,"DNA, Neoplasm",,,,"Tavassoli, F.A., Schnitt, S.J., (1992) Pathology of the Breast, , Elsevier, New York; Eisen, M.B., Brown, P.O., DNA arrays for analysis of gene expression (1999) Methods Enzymol., 303, pp. 179-205; Ross, D.T., Systematic variation in gene expression patterns in human cancer cell lines (2000) Nature Genet., 24, pp. 227-235; Aas, T., Specific P53 mutations are associated with de novo resistance to doxorubicin in breast cancer patients (1996) Nature Med, 2, pp. 811-814; Eisen, M.B., Spellman, P.T., Brown, P.O., Botstein, D., Cluster analysis and display of genome-wide expression patterns (1998) Proc.

However, about 10 percent of patients have a rapid and often dramatic clinical response. The molecular mechanisms underlying sensitivity to gefitinib are unknown. METHODS: We searched for mutations in the EGFR gene in primary tumors from patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who had a response to gefitinib, those who did not have a response, and those who had not been exposed to gefitinib. The functional consequences of identified mutations were evaluated after the mutant proteins were expressed in cultured cells. RESULTS: Somatic mutations were identified in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene in eight of nine patients with gefitinib-responsive lung cancer, as compared with none of the seven patients with no response (P<0.001). Mutations were either small, in-frame deletions or amino acid substitutions clustered around the ATP-binding pocket of the tyrosine kinase domain. Similar mutations were detected in tumors from 2 of 25 patients with primary non-small-cell lung cancer who had not been exposed to gefitinib (8 percent). All mutations were heterozygous, and identical mutations were observed in multiple patients, suggesting an additive specific gain of function. In vitro, EGFR mutants demonstrated enhanced tyrosine kinase activity in response to epidermal growth factor and increased sensitivity to inhibition by gefitinib. CONCLUSIONS: A subgroup of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer have specific mutations in the EGFR gene, which correlate with clinical responsiveness to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib. These mutations lead to increased growth factor signaling and confer susceptibility to the inhibitor. Screening for such mutations in lung cancers may identify patients who will have a response to gefitinib.",,"carboplatin; docetaxel; epidermal growth factor receptor; gefitinib; gemcitabine; navelbine;

METHODS: Of 813 patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer, we randomly assigned 402 to receive irinotecan, bolus fluorouracil and leucovorin (IFL) plus bevacizumab (5 mg per kilogram of body weight every two weeks) and 411 to receive IFL plus placebo. The primary end point was overall survival. Secondary end points were progression-free survival, the response rate, the duration of the response, safety, and the quality of life. RESULTS: The median duration of survival was 20.3 months in the group given IFL plus bevacizumab, as compared with 15.6 months in the group given IFL plus placebo, corresponding to a hazard ratio for death of 0.66 (P<0.001). The median duration of progression-free survival was 10.6 months in the group given IFL plus bevacizumab, as compared with 6.2 months in the group given IFL plus placebo (hazard ratio for disease progression, 0.54; P<0.001); the corresponding rates of response were 44.8 percent and 34.8 percent (P=0.004). The median duration of the response was 10.4 months in the group given IFL plus bevacizumab, as compared with 7.1 months in the group given IFL plus placebo (hazard ratio for progression, 0.62; P=0.001). Grade 3 hypertension was more common during treatment with IFL plus bevacizumab than with IFL plus placebo (11.0 percent vs. 2.3 percent) but was easily managed. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of bevacizumab to fluorouracil-based combination chemotherapy results in statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in survival among patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Microarray","RNA; analytic method; article; cancer; cancer survival; chromosome; computer program; controlled study; data base; DNA microarray; female; gene expression profiling; gene function; gene set enrichment analysis; genome; human; human cell; human tissue; leukemia; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; medical research; priority journal; Cell Line, Tumor; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Genes, p53; Genome; Humans; Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Acute; Leukemia, Myelocytic, Acute; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis",,"RNA, 63231-63-0","MSigDB 1.0",,,"Schena, M., Shalon, D., Davis, R.W., Brown, P.O., (1995) Science, 270, pp. 467-470; Lockhart, D.J., Dong, H., Byrne, M.C., Follettie, M.T., Gallo, M.V., Chee, M.S., Mittmann, M., Horion, H., (1996) Nat.

Using a subtractive hybridization approach, we identified a gene, named WAF1, whose induction was associated with wild-type but not mutant p53 gene expression in a human brain tumor cell line. The WAF1 gene was localized to chromosome 6p21.2, and its sequence, structure, and activation by p53 was conserved in rodents. Introduction of WAF1 cDNA suppressed the growth of human brain, lung, and colon tumor cells in culture. Using a yeast enhancer trap, a p53-binding site was identified 2.4 kb upstream of WAF1 coding sequences. The WAF1 promoter, including this p53-binding site, conferred p53-dependent inducibility upon a heterologous reporter gene. These studies define a gene whose expression is directly induced by p53 and that could be an important mediator of p53-dependent tumor growth suppression. © 1993.",,"amino acid; dna; messenger rna; protein p53; amino acid sequence; animal cell; article; binding site; cancer inhibition; chromosomal localization; chromosome 6p; controlled study; dna binding; dna probe; dna sequence; exon; gene; gene activation; gene expression; gene sequence; gene structure; human; human cell; hybridization; mouse; nonhuman; northern blotting; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; reporter gene; tumor cell; Amino Acid Sequence; Animal; Base Sequence; Cell Cycle; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6; Cloning, Molecular; Cyclins; DNA Primers; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes, Structural; Genes, Tumor Suppressor; Human; Mice; Molecular Sequence Data; Nuclear Proteins; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Protein p53; Rats; RNA, Messenger; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Zinc Fingers; Animalia; Rodentia","GENBANK: L20888, L20889, L22499, L26083, L33709, S60904, S60905, S60924, U00968, U03106","Cip1 protein; Cyclins; DNA Primers; Nuclear Proteins; Protein p53; RNA, Messenger",,,,"Baker, Fearon, Nigro, Hamilton, Preisinger, Jessup, van Tuinen, Vogelstein, Chromosome 17 deletions and p53 gene mutations in colorectal carcinomas (1989) Science, 244, pp. 217-221; Baker, Markowitz, Fearon, Willson, Vogelstein, Suppression of human colorectal carcinoma cell growth by wild-type p53 (1990) Science, 249, pp. 912-915; Barak, Juven, Haffner, Oren, Mdm-2 expression is induced by wild-type p53 activity (1993) EMBO, 12, pp. 461-468; Berg, Potential metal-binding domains in nucleic acid binding proteins (1986) Science, 232, pp. 485-487; Clarke, Purdie, Harrison, Morris, Bird, Hooper, Wyllie, Thymocyte apoptosis induced by p53-dependent and independent pathways (1993) Nature, 362, pp. 849-852; Cliby, Ritland, Hartmann, Dodson, Halling, Keeney, Podratz, Jenkins, Human epithelial ovarian cancer allelotype (1993) Cancer Res., 53, pp. 2393-2398; Davis, Dibner, Battey, (1986) Basic Methods in Molecular Biology, , Elsevier Science Publishing, New York; El-Deiry, Nelkin, Celano, Yen, Falco, Hamilton, Baylin, High expression of the DNA methyltransferase gene characterizes human neoplastic cells and progression stages of colon cancer (1991) Proc.

Published approaches, generally associated with studies of leukemia, not dependent on knowledge of the underlying population for their validity, are directed towards identifying clustering by establishing a relationship between the temporal and the spatial separations for the n(n −1)/2 possible pairs which can be formed from the n observed cases of disease. Here it is proposed that statistical power can be improved by applying a reciprocal trans form to these separations. While a permutational approach can give valid probability levels for any observed association, for reasons of practicability, it is suggested that the observed association be tested relative to its permutational variance. Formulas and computational procedures for doing so are given. While the distance measures between points represent symmetric relationships subject to mathematical and geometric regularities, the variance formula developed is appropriate for arbitrary relationships. Simplified procedures are given for the ease of symmetric and skew-symmetric relationships. The general procedure is indicated as being potentially useful in other situations as, for example, the study of interpersonal relationships. Viewing the procedure as a regression approach, the possibility for extending it to nonlinear and multivariate situations is suggested. Other aspects of the problem and of the procedure developed are discussed. © 1967, American Association for Cancer Research.

Methods: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab, a recombinant monoclonal antibody against HER2, in women with metastatic breast cancer that overexpressed HER2. We randomly assigned 234 patients to receive standard chemotherapy alone and 235 patients to receive standard chemotherapy plus trastuzumab. Patients who had not previously received adjuvant (postoperative) therapy with an anthracycline were treated with doxorubicin (or epirubicin in the case of 36 women) and cyclophosphamide with (143 women) or without trastuzumab (138 women). Patients who had previously received adjuvant anthracycline were treated with paclitaxel alone (96 women) or paclitaxel with trastuzumab (92 women). Results: The addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy was associated with a longer time to disease progression (median, 7.4 vs. 4.6 months; P<0.001), a higher rate of objective response (50 percent vs. 32 percent, P<0.001), a longer duration of response (median, 9.1 vs. 6.1 months; P<0.001), a lower rate of death at 1 year (22 percent vs. 33 percent, P=0.008), longer survival (median survival, 25.1 vs. 20.3 months; P=0.046), and a 20 percent reduction in the risk of death. The most important adverse event was cardiac dysfunction, which occurred in 27 percent of the group given an anthracycline, cyclophosphamide, and trastuzumab; 8 percent of the group given an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide alone; 13 percent of the group given paclitaxel and trastuzumab; and 1 percent of the group given paclitaxel alone. Although the cardiotoxicity was potentially severe and, in some cases, life-threatening, the symptoms generally improved with standard medical management. Conclusions Trastuzumab increases the clinical benefit of first-line chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses HER2.",,"cyclophosphamide; doxorubicin; epidermal growth factor receptor;

Hosp. Universitaire Vaudois, Lausanne, Switzerland","BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumor in adults, is usually rapidly fatal. The current standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma is surgical resection to the extent feasible, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. In this trial we compared radiotherapy alone with radiotherapy plus temozolomide, given concomitantly with and after radiotherapy, in terms of efficacy and safety. METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed glioblastoma were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy alone (fractionated focal irradiation in daily fractions of 2 Gy given 5 days per week for 6 weeks, for a total of 60 Gy) or radiotherapy plus continuous daily temozolomide (75 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day, 7 days per week from the first to the last day of radiotherapy), followed by six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide (150 to 200 mg per square meter for 5 days during each 28-day cycle). The primary end point was overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 573 patients from 85 centers underwent randomization. The median age was 56 years, and 84 percent of patients had undergone debulking surgery. At a median follow-up of 28 months, the median survival was 14.6 months with radiotherapy plus temozolomide and 12.1 months with radiotherapy alone. The unadjusted hazard ratio for death in the radiotherapy-plus-temozolomide group was 0.63 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.75; P<0.001 by the log-rank test). The two-year survival rate was 26.5 percent with radiotherapy plus temozolomide and 10.4 percent with radiotherapy alone. Concomitant treatment with radiotherapy plus temozolomide resulted in grade 3 or 4 hematologie toxic effects in 7 percent of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of temozolomide to radiotherapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma resulted in a clinically meaningful and statistically significant survival benefit with minimal additional toxicity.

A total of 1,660,290 new cancer cases and 580,350 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States in 2013. During the most recent 5 years for which there are data (2005-2009), delay-adjusted cancer incidence rates declined slightly in men (by 0.6% per year) and were stable in women, while cancer death rates decreased by 1.8% per year in men and by 1.5% per year in women. Overall, cancer death rates have declined 20% from their peak in 1991 (215.1 per 100,000 population) to 2009 (173.1 per 100,000 population). Death rates continue to decline for all 4 major cancer sites (lung, colorectum, breast, and prostate). Over the past 10 years of data (2000-2009), the largest annual declines in death rates were for chronic myeloid leukemia (8.4%), cancers of the stomach (3.1%) and colorectum (3.0%), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (3.0%). The reduction in overall cancer death rates since 1990 in men and 1991 in women translates to the avoidance of approximately 1.18 million deaths from cancer, with 152,900 of these deaths averted in 2009 alone. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population, with an emphasis on those groups in the lowest socioeconomic bracket and other underserved populations. © 2013 American Cancer Society.

This gene has been shown to be amplified in human breast cancer cell lines. In the current study, alterations of the gene in 189 primary human breast cancers were investigated. HER-2/neu was found to be amplified from 2- to greater than 20-fold in 30% of the tumors. Correlation of gene amplification with several disease parameters was evaluated. Amplification of the HER-2/neu gene was a significant predictor of both overall survival and time to relapse in patients with breast cancer. It retained its significance even when adjustments were made for other known prognostic factors. Moreover, HER-2/neu amplification had greater prognostic value than most currently used prognostic factors, including hormonal-receptor status, in lymph node-positive disease. These data indicate that this gene may play a role in the biologic behavior and/or pathogenesis of human breast cancer.",,"epidermal growth factor receptor; breast; breast cancer; cancer mortality; cancer recurrence; diagnosis; etiology; gene amplification; genetic engineering; heredity; human; human cell; oncogene; priority journal; Axilla; Breast Neoplasms; DNA; Female; Gene Amplification; Humans; Lymph Nodes; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; Oncogenes; Prognosis; Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor",,"epidermal growth factor receptor, 79079-06-4; DNA, 9007-49-2; Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor, 2.7.1.112",,,,,,,,,,,,,00368075,,SCIEA,3798106,"English","SCIENCE",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023084858

This report considers incidence data through 2003 and mortality data through 2004. Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard million population. A total of 1,444,920 new cancer cases and 559,650 deaths for cancers are projected to occur in the United States in 2007. Notable trends in cancer incidence and mortality rates include stabilization of the age-standardized, delay-adjusted incidence rates for all cancers combined in men from 1995 through 2003; a continuing increase in the incidence rate by 0.3% per year in women; and a 13.6% total decrease in age-standardized cancer death rates among men and women combined between 1991 and 2004. This report also examines cancer incidence, mortality, and survival by site, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and calendar year, as well as the proportionate contribution of selected sites to the overall trends. While the absolute number of cancer deaths decreased for the second consecutive year in the United States (by more than 3,000 from 2003 to 2004) and much progress has been made in reducing mortality rates and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in persons under age 85 years. Further progress can be accelerated by supporting new discoveries and by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population. © American Cancer Society, Inc., 2007.",,"adult; aged; article; cancer; cancer growth; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer recurrence; cancer survival; controlled study; ethnicity; female; geography; human; major clinical study; male; medical record; priority journal; statistical analysis; United States; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cause of Death; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Geography; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Neoplasms; Population Surveillance; Risk Assessment; Sex Distribution; Survival Analysis; United States",,,,,,"Centers for Disease Control, , http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss.htm, National Center for Health Statistics, Division of Vital Statistics, Available at:, Accessed November 22, 2006; National Cancer Institute, U.S. National Institutes of Health.

In such populations, therefore, reducing LDL cholesterol may reduce the development of vascular disease, largely irrespective of initial cholesterol concentrations. Methods: 20 536 UK adults (aged 40-80 years) with coronary disease, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin daily (average compliance: 85%) or matching placebo (average non-study statin use: 17%). Analyses are of the first occurrence of particular events, and compare all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants. These ""intention-to-treat"" comparisons assess the effects of about two-thirds (85% minus 17%) taking a statin during the scheduled 5-year treatment period, which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (about two-thirds of the effect of actual use of 40 mg simvastatin daily). Primary outcomes were mortality (for overall analyses) and fatal or non-fatal vascular events (for subcategory analyses), with subsidiary assessments of cancer and of other major morbidity. Findings: All-cause mortality was significantly reduced (1328 [12.9%] deaths among 10 269 allocated simvastatin versus 1507 [14.7%] among 10 267 allocated placebo; p=0.0003), due to a highly significant 18% (SE 5) proportional reduction in the coronary death rate (587 [5.7%] vs 707 [6.9%]; p=0.0005), a marginally significant reduction in other vascular deaths (194 [1.9%] vs 230 [2.2%]; p=0.07), and a non-significant reduction in non-vascular deaths (547 [5.3%] vs 570 [5.6%]; p=0.4). There were highly significant reductions of about one-quarter in the first event rate for non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death (898 [8.7%] vs 1212 [11.8%]; p<0.0001), for non-fatal or fatal stroke (444 [4.3%] vs 585 [5.7%]; p<0.0001), and for coronary or non-coronary revascularisation (939 [9.1%] vs 1205 [11.7%]; p<0.0001). For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events, there was a definite 24% (SE 3; 95% CI 19-28) reduction in the event rate (2033 [19.8%] vs 2585 [25.2%] affected individuals; p<0.0001). During the first year the reduction in major vascular events was not significant, but subsequently it was highly significant during each separate year. The proportional reduction in the event rate was similar (and significant) in each subcategory of participant studied, including: those without diagnosed coronary disease who had cerebrovascular disease, or had peripheral artery disease, or had diabetes; men and, separately, women; those aged either under or over 70 years at entry; and - most notably - even those who presented with LDL cholesterol below 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL), or total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). The benefits of simvastatin were additional to those of other cardioprotective treatments. The annual excess risk of myopathy with this regimen was about 0.01%. There were no significant adverse effects on cancer incidence or on hospitalisation for any other non-vascular cause. Interpretation: Adding simvastatin to existing treatments safely produces substantial additional benefits for a wide range of high-risk patients, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rates of myocardial infarction, of stroke, and of revascularisation by about one-quarter. After making allowance for non-compliance, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce these rates by about one-third. Hence, among the many types of high-risk individual studied, 5 years of simvastatin would prevent about 70-100 people per 1000 from suffering at least one of these major vascular events (and longer treatment should produce further benefit). The size of the 5-year benefit depends chiefly on such individuals' overall risk of major vascular events, rather than on their blood lipid concentrations alone.",,"hypocholesterolemic agent; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; placebo; simvastatin; adult; aged; article; cancer; cardiomyopathy; cardiovascular risk; cause of death; cerebrovascular disease; cholesterol blood level; clinical trial; comparative study; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; coronary artery disease; diabetes mellitus; drug use; female; heart infarction; heart protection; high risk population; human; major clinical study; male; morbidity; mortality; patient compliance; peripheral occlusive artery disease; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; statistical significance; stroke; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anticholesteremic Agents; Cause of Death; Cerebrovascular Accident; Cholesterol, LDL; Coronary Disease; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Great Britain; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Patient Compliance; Severity of Illness Index; Simvastatin",,"simvastatin, 79902-63-9; Anticholesteremic Agents; Cholesterol, LDL; Simvastatin, 79902-63-9",,,,"Jacobs, D., Blackburn, H., Higgins, M., For participants in the conference on low cholesterol:mortality associations.

The method is suitable for ordinary laboratory purposes and for very large-scale applications, such as the National Cancer Institute's disease-oriented in vitro anticancer-drug discovery screen, which requires the use of several million culture wells per year. Cultures fixed with trichloroacetic acid were stained for 30 minutes with 0.4% (wt/vol) sulforhodoamine B (SRB) dissolved in 1% acetic acid. Unbound dye was removed by four washes with 1% acetic acid, and protein-bound dye was extracted with 10 mM unbuffered Tris base [tris (hydroxymethyl)aminomethane] for determination of optical density in a computer-interfaced, 96-well microtiter plate reader. The SRB assay results were linear with the number of cells and with values for cellular protein measured by both the Lowry and Bradford assays at densities ranging from sparse subconfluence to multilayered supraconfluence. The signal-to-noise ratio at 564 nm was approximately 1.5 with 1,000 cells per well. The sensitivity of the SRB assay compared favorable with sensitivities of several fluorescence assays and was superior to those of both the Lowry and Bradford assays and to those of 20 other visible dyes. The SRB assay provides a colorimetric end point that is nondestructive, indefinitely stable, and visible to the naked eye. It provides a sensitive measure of drug-induced cytotoxicity, is useful in quantitating clonogenicity, and is well suited to high-volume, automated drug screening. SRB fluoresces strongly with laser excitation at 488 nm and can be measured quantitatively at the single-cell level by static fluorescence cytometry.",,"antineoplastic agent; article; cell culture; colorimetry; drug cytotoxicity; drug screening; human; human cell; methodology; priority journal; tumor cell line; Adenocarcinoma; Calibration; Cell Count; Colonic Neoplasms; Colorimetry; Comparative Study; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; Dyes; Female; Human; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Least-Squares Analysis; Microchemistry; Rhodamines; Trichloroacetic Acid; Tumor Cells, Cultured",,"Dyes; lissamine rhodamine B, 2609-88-3; Rhodamines; Trichloroacetic Acid, 76-03-9",,,,,"Skeham, P.; Developm.

Many cancers arise from sites of infection, chronic irritation and inflammation. It is now becoming clear that the tumour microenvironment, which is largely orchestrated by inflammatory cells, is an indispensable participant in the neoplastic process, fostering proliferation, survival and migration. In addition, tumour cells have co-opted some of the signalling molecules of the innate immune system, such as selectins, chemokines and their receptors for invasion, migration and metastasis. These insights are fostering new anti-inflammatory therapeutic approaches to cancer development.",,"Carcinogens; Cells; Neoplastic process; Tumor microenvironment; Tumors; chemokine; cytokine; transforming growth factor alpha; transforming growth factor beta; cancer; medicine; angiogenesis; cancer; cancer growth; carcinogenesis; human; inflammation; inflammatory cell; leukocyte adherence; metastasis; pathogenesis; priority journal; regulatory mechanism; review; tissue repair; wound healing; Animals; Chemokines; Chronic Disease; Disease Progression; Humans; Inflammation; Leukocytes; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasms; Neovascularization, Pathologic",,"Chemokines",,,,"Balkwill, F., Mantovani, A., Inflammation and cancer: Back to Virchow?

Somatic mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene EGFR were found in 15 of 58 unselected tumors from Japan and 1 of 61 from the United States. Treatment with the EGFR kinase inhibitor gefitinib (Iressa) causes tumor regression in some patients with NSCLC, more frequently in Japan. EGFR mutations were found in additional lung cancer samples from U.S. patients who responded to gefitinib therapy and in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line that was hypersensitive to growth inhibition by gefitinib, but not in gefitinib-insensitive tumors or cell lines.

We proposed that this variability in natural history reflects unrecognized molecular heterogeneity in the tumours. Using DNA microarrays, we have conducted a systematic characterization of gene expression in B-cell malignancies. Here we show that there is diversity in gene expression among the tumours of DLBCL patients, apparently reflecting the variation in tumour proliferation rate, host response and differentiation state of the tumour. We identified two molecularly distinct forms of DLBCL which had gene expression patterns indicative of different stages of B-cell differentiation. One type expressed genes characteristic of germinal centre B cells ('germinal centre B-like DLBCL'); the second type expressed genes normally induced during in vitro activation of peripheral blood B cells ('activated B-like DLBCL'). Patients with germinal centre B-like DLBCL had a significantly better overall survival than those with activated B-like DLBCL. The molecular classification of tumours on the basis of gene expression can thus identify previously undetected and clinically significant subtypes of cancer.",,"article; B cell lymphoma; cancer survival; carcinogenesis; DNA determination; genetic analysis; genetic heterogeneity; human; phenotype; priority journal; Adult; B-Lymphocytes; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic; Lymphoma, B-Cell; Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Diffuse; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Phenotype; Tumor Cells, Cultured",,,,,,"Hodgkin, T., On some morbid appearances of the absorbant glands and spleen (1832) Med. -chir.

The p53 mutational spectrum differs among cancers of the colon, lung, esophagus, breast, liver, brain, reticuloendothelial tissues, and hemopoietic tissues. Analysis of these mutations can provide clues to the etiology of these diverse tumors and to the function of specific regions of p53. Transitions predominate in colon, brain, and lymphoid malignancies, whereas G:C to T:A transversions are the most frequent substitutions observed in cancers of the lung and liver. Mutations at A:T base pairs are seen more frequently in esophageal carcinomas than in other solid tumors. Most transitions in colorectal carcinomas, brain rumors, leukemias, and lymphomas are at CpG dinucleotide mutational hot spots. G to T transversions in lung, breast, and esophageal carcinomas are dispersed among numerous codons. In liver tumors in persons from geographic areas in which both aflatoxin B1 and hepatitis B virus are cancer risk factors, most mutations are at one nucleotide pair of codon 249.

The strongest predictors for metastases (for example, lymph node status and histological grade) fail to classify accurately breast tumours according to their clinical behaviour. Chemotherapy or hormonal therapy reduces the risk of distant metastases by approximately one-third; however, 70-80% of patients receiving this treatment would have survived without it. None of the signatures of breast cancer gene expression reported to date allow for patient-tailored therapy strategies. Here we used DNA microarray analysis on primary breast tumours of 117 young patients, and applied supervised classification to identify a gene expression signature strongly predictive of a short interval to distant metastases ('poor prognosis' signature) in patients without tumour cells in local lymph nodes at diagnosis (lymph node negative). In addition, we established a signature that identifies tumours of BRCA1 carriers. The poor prognosis signature consists of genes regulating cell cycle, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. This gene expression profile will outperform all currently used clinical parameters in predicting disease outcome. Our findings provide a strategy to select patients who would benefit from adjuvant therapy.",,"Cells; Chemotherapy; Diagnosis; DNA; Hormones; Patient treatment; Tumors; Local lymph nodes; Genes; cancer; adult; angiogenesis; article; breast cancer; cancer invasion; cell cycle; controlled study; DNA microarray; female; gene expression profiling; gene identification; heterozygote; human; human tissue; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; nucleotide sequence; oncogene; outcomes research; priority journal; prognosis; Adult; Breast Neoplasms; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Cluster Analysis; DNA, Neoplasm; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Genes, BRCA1; Genes, BRCA2; Humans; Lymphatic Metastasis; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Patient Selection; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Treatment Outcome","GENBANK: AF052162, AF103458, AF103530, AI049265, AJ249377, AL080059, AL080192, AL133074, AL133619, AL137718","DNA, Neoplasm",,,,"McGuire, W.L., Breast cancer prognostic factors: Evaluation guidelines (1991) J.

Purpose: We report here the results of an international field study of the practicality, reliability, and validity of the EORTC QLQ-C30, the current core questionnaire. The QLQ-C30 incorporates nine multi-item scales: five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting); and a global health and quality-of-life scale. Several single-item symptom measures are also included. Methods: The questionnaire was administered before treatment and once during treatment to 305 patients with nonresectable lung cancer from centers in 13 countries. Clinical variables assessed included disease stage, weight loss, performance status, and treatment toxicity. Results: The average time required to complete the questionnaire was approximately 11 minutes, and most patients required no assistance. The data supported the hypothesized scale structure of the questionnaire with the exception of role functioning (work and household activities), which was also the only multi-item scale that failed to meet the minimal standards for reliability (Cronbach's alpha coefficient ≥.70) either before or during treatment. Validity was shown by three findings. First, while all interscale correlations were statistically significant, the correlation was moderate, indicating that the scales were assessing distinct components of the quality-of-life construct. Second, most of the functional and symptom measures discriminated clearly between patients differing in clinical status as defined by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status scale, weight loss, and treatment toxicity. Third, there were statistically significant changes, in the expected direction, in physical and role functioning, global quality of life, fatigue, and nausea and vomiting, for patients whose performance status had improved or worsened during treatment. The reliability and validity of the questionnaire were highly consistent across the three language-cultural groups studied: patients from English-speaking countries, Northern Europe, and Southern Europe. Conclusions: These results support the EORTC QLQ-C30 as a reliable and valid measure of the quality of life of cancer patients in multicultural clinical research settings. Work is ongoing to examine the performance of the questionnaire among more heterogenous patient samples and in phase II and phase III clinical trials.",,"adult; aged; article; cancer research; demography; europe; female; functional assessment; health care organization; human; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; performance; priority journal; quality of life; scoring system; Activities of Daily Living; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Clinical Trials; Female; Health Status; Human; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Age; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Reproducibility of Results",,,,,,,"Aaronson, N.K.; Div.

A total of 85 cDNA microarray experiments representing 78 cancers, three fibroadenomas, and four normal breast tissues were analyzed by hierarchical clustering. As reported previously, the cancers could be classified into a basal epithelial-like group, an ERBB2-overexpressing group and a normal breast-like group based on variations in gene expression. A novel finding was that the previously characterized luminal epithelial/estrogen receptor-positive group could be divided into at least two subgroups, each with a distinctive expression profile. These subtypes proved to be reasonably robust by clustering using two different gene sets: first, a set of 456 cDNA clones previously selected to reflect intrinsic properties of the tumors and, second, a gene set that highly correlated with patient outcome. Survival analyses on a subcohort of patients with locally advanced breast cancer uniformly treated in a prospective study showed significantly different outcomes for the patients belonging to the various groups, including a poor prognosis for the basal-like subtype and a significant difference in outcome for the two estrogen receptor-positive groups.",,"complementary DNA; estrogen receptor; article; breast carcinoma; cancer classification; cancer diagnosis; cancer survival; clinical feature; controlled study; diagnostic procedure; DNA microarray; fibroadenoma; gene expression; human; major clinical study; oncogene neu; priority journal; prognosis; prospective study; unindexed sequence; Algorithms; Breast Neoplasms; Carcinoma in Situ; Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast; Carcinoma, Lobular; DNA, Neoplasm; Female; Fibroadenoma; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53","AA010188, AA026264, AA026642, AA030004, AA033947, AA055485, AA115275, AA181334, AA192547, AA400464, AA425217, AA443351, AA446222, AA452513, AA455800, AA455925, AA456878, AA457238, AA480116, AA504615, AA598826, AA599175, AA600214, AA609598, AA633835, AA664180, AA668821, AA677534, AI304356, H13688, H21329, H53702, N39161, N48082, N54470, R01118, R09416, R66139, R72913, T52068, T57034, T72076, T74979, W42723, W51779, W72051, W72110, W81185, W87528, W93120","DNA, Neoplasm; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53",,,,"Fisher, E.R., Costantino, J., Fisher, B., Redmond, C., (1993) Cancer, 71, pp. 2141-2150; Elston, C.W., Ellis, I.O., (1991) Histopathology, 19, pp. 403-410; Torregrosa, D., Bolufer, P., Lluch, A., Lopez, J.A., Barragan, E., Ruiz, A., Guillem, V., Garcia Conde, J., (1997) Clin.

Although much is known about the control of cell proliferation,less is known about the control of cell death. Physiologic cell death occurs primarily through an evolutionary conserved form of cell suicide termed apoptosis. The decision of a cell to undergo apoptosis can be influenced by a wide variety of regulatory stimuli. Recent evidence suggests that alterations in cell survival contribute to the pathogenesis of a number of human diseases, including cancer, viral infections, autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).

These breast tumors are comprised of phenotypically diverse populations of breast cancer cells. Using a model in which human breast cancer cells were grown in immunocompromised mice, we found that only a minority of breast cancer cells had the ability to form new tumors. We were able to distinguish the tumorigenic (tumor initiating) from the non-tumorigenic cancer cells based on cell surface marker expression. We prospectively identified and isolated the tumorigenic cells as CD44+CD24-/lowLineage- in eight of nine patients. As few as 100 cells with this phenotype were able to form tumors in mice, whereas tens of thousands of cells with alternate phenotypes failed to form tumors. The tumorigenic subpopulation could be serially passaged: each time cells within this population generated new tumors containing additional CD44+CD24-/lowLineage- tumorigenic cells as well as the phenotypically diverse mixed populations of nontumorigenic cells present in the initial tumor. The ability to prospectively identify tumorigenic cancer cells will facilitate the elucidation of pathways that regulate their growth and survival. Furthermore, because these cells drive tumor development, strategies designed to target this population may lead to more effective therapies.",,"animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; breast cancer; breast carcinogenesis; cancer cell; cell growth; cell isolation; cell lineage; cell population; cell surface; cell survival; controlled study; female; human; human cell; immune deficiency; mouse; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; animal; breast tumor; flow cytometry; metastasis; mouse mutant; nonobese diabetic mouse; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; pleura effusion; xenograft; Animalia; leukocyte antigen; Animals; Antigens, CD; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Flow Cytometry; Humans; Mice; Mice, Inbred NOD; Mice, SCID; Neoplasm Metastasis; Pleural Effusion; Transplantation, Heterologous",,"Antigens, CD",,,,"Stockler, M., Wilcken, N.R., Ghersi, D., Simes, R.J., (2000) Cancer Treat.

Unequivocal proof that stem cells exist in the haematopoietic system has given way to the prospective isolation of several tissue-specific stem and progenitor cells, the initial delineation of their properties and expressed genetic programmes, and the beginnings of their utility in regenerative medicine. Perhaps the most important and useful property of stem cells is that of self-renewal. Through this property, striking parallels can be found between stem cells and cancer cells: tumours may often originate from the transformation of normal stem cells, similar signalling pathways may regulate self-renewal in stem cells and cancer cells, and cancer cells may include 'cancer stem cells' - rare cells with indefinite potential for self-renewal that drive tumorigenesis.",,"Biomedical engineering; Diseases; Genes; Tumors; Stem cells; Cells; biochemistry; biotechnology; cancer; cancer cell; carcinogenesis; cell isolation; cell renewal; cell transformation; gene expression; gene mutation; hematopoietic stem cell; human; nonhuman; organogenesis; priority journal; review; signal transduction; stem cell; tissue specificity; Animals; Cell Division; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Humans; Leukemia; Mutation; Neoplasms; Regeneration; Signal Transduction; Stem Cells",,,,,,"Spangrude, G.J., Heimfeld, S., Weissman, I.L., Purification and characterization of mouse hematopoietic stem cells (1988) Science, 241, pp. 58-62; Morrison, S.J., Weissman, I.L., The long-term repopulating subset of hematopoiet: Stem cells is deterministic and isolatable by phenotype (1994) Immunity, 1, pp. 661-673; Baum, C.M., Weissman, I.L., Tsukamoto, A.S., Buckcle, A.M., Buckle, A.M., Peault, B., Isolation of a candidate human hematopoietic stem-cell population (1992) Proc.

Observational studies have found lower rates of coronary heart disease (CHD) in postmenopausal women who take estrogen than in women who do not, but this potential benefit has not been confirmed in clinical trials. Objective. To determine if estrogen plus progestin therapy alters the risk for CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary disease. Design. Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled secondary prevention trial. Setting. Outpatient and community settings at 20 US clinical centers. Participants. A total of 2763 women with coronary disease, younger than 80 years, and postmenopausal with an intact uterus. Mean age was 66.7 years. Intervention. Either 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogens plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate in 1 tablet daily (n = 1380) or a placebo of identical appearance (n = 1383). Follow-up averaged 4.1 years; 82% of those assigned to hormone treatment were taking it at the end of 1 year, and 75% at the end of 3 years. Main Outcome Measures. The primary outcome was the occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or CHD death. Secondary cardiovascular outcomes included coronary revascularization, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest, stroke or transient ischemic attack, and peripheral arterial disease. All-cause mortality was also considered. Results. - Overall, there were no significant differences between groups in the primary outcome or in any of the secondary cardiovascular outcomes: 172 women in the hormone group and 176 women in the placebo group had MI or CHD death (relative hazard [RH], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-1.22). The lack of an overall effect occurred despite a net 11% lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and 10% higher high- density lipoprotein cholesterol level in the hormone group compared with the placebo group (each P<.001). Within the overall null effect, there was a statistically significant time trend, with more CHD events in the hormone group than in the placebo group in year 1 and fewer in years 4 and 5. More women in the hormone group than in the placebo group experienced venous thromboembolic events (34 vs 12; RH, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.50-5.58) and gallbladder disease (84 vs 62; RH, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.00-1.92). There were no significant differences in several other end points for which power was limited, including fracture, cancer, and total mortality (131 vs 123 deaths; RH, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.84-1.38). Conclusions. - During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with oral conjugated equine estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary disease. The treatment did increase the rate of thromboembolic events and gallbladder disease. Based on the finding of no overall cardiovascular benefit and a pattern of early increase in risk of CHD events, we do not recommend starting this treatment for the purpose of secondary prevention of CHD. However, given the favorable pattern of CHD events after several years of therapy, it could be appropriate for women already receiving this treatment to continue.",,"estrogen; gestagen; medroxyprogesterone acetate; placebo; adult; aged; article; clinical trial; controlled study; coronary risk; double blind procedure; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug safety; estrogen therapy; female; high risk population; human; ischemic heart disease; lipid blood level; major clinical study; oral drug administration; postmenopause; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; risk benefit analysis; secondary prevention; Aged; Coronary Disease; Double-Blind Method; Drug Combinations; Estrogen Replacement Therapy; Estrogens, Conjugated (USP); Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Lipoproteins; Medroxyprogesterone 17-Acetate; Middle Aged; Postmenopause; Progesterone Congeners; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk; Survival Analysis",,"Drug Combinations; Estrogens, Conjugated (USP); Lipoproteins; Medroxyprogesterone 17-Acetate, 71-58-9; Progesterone Congeners",,,,"Bush, T.L., Noncontraceptive estrogen use and risk of cardiovascular disease: An overview and critique of the literature (1990) The Menopause: Biological and Clinical Consequences of Ovarian Failure: Evolution and Management, pp. 211-223. , Korenman SG, ed.

As the first stage of a systematic genomewide screen for these genes, we have prioritized for analysis signalling pathways in which at least one gene is mutated in human cancer. The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK-MAP kinase pathway mediates cellular responses to growth signals1. RAS is mutated to an oncogenic form in about 15% of human cancer. The three RAF genes code for cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinases that are regulated by binding RAS1-3. Here we report BRAF somatic missense mutations in 66% of malignant melanomas and at lower frequency in a wide range of human cancers. All mutations are within the kinase domain, with a single substitution (V599E) accounting for 80%. Mutated BRAF proteins have elevated kinase activity and are transforming in NIH3T3 cells. Furthermore, RAS function is not required for the growth of cancer cell lines with the V599E mutation. As BRAF is a serine/threonine kinase that is commonly activated by somatic point mutation in human cancer, it may provide new therapeutic opportunities in malignant melanoma.",,"Cytology; Enzymes; Genes; Mutations; Oncology; cancer; gene; mutation; amino acid substitution; article; cancer; cell death; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; gene mutation; malignant neoplastic disease; missense mutation; nonhuman; point mutation; priority journal; 3T3 Cells; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Base Sequence; Cell Division; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; DNA Mutational Analysis; Enzyme Activation; Humans; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Melanoma; Mice; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation, Missense; Neoplasms; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf; ras Proteins; Tumor Cells, Cultured",,"BRAF protein, human, EC 2.7.1.37; Braf protein, mouse, EC 2.7.1.37; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases, EC 2.7.1.37; Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf, EC 2.7.1.37; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf, EC 2.7.1.37; ras Proteins, EC 3.6.5.2",,,,"Peyssonnaux, C., Eychène, A., The Raf/MEK/ERK pathway: New concepts of activation (2001) Biol.

Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard million population. A total of 1,372,910 new cancer cases and 570,280 deaths are expected in the United States in 2005. When deaths are aggregated by age, cancer has surpassed heart disease as the leading cause of death for persons younger than 85 since 1999. When adjusted to delayed reporting, cancer incidence rates stabilized in men from 1995 through 2001 but continued to increase by 0.3% per year from 1987 through 2001 in women. The death rate from all cancers combined has decreased by 1.5% per year since 1993 among men and by 0.8% per year since 1992 among women. The mortality rate has also continued to decrease from the three most common cancer sites in men (lung and bronchus, colon and rectum, and prostate) and from breast and colorectal cancers in women. Lung cancer mortality among women has leveled off after increasing for many decades. In analyses by race and ethnicity, African American men and women have 40% and 20% higher death rates from all cancers combined than White men and women, respectively. Cancer incidence and death rates are lower in other racial and ethnic groups than in Whites and African Americans for all sites combined and for the four major cancer sites. However, these groups generally have higher rates for stomach, liver, and cervical cancers than Whites. Furthermore, minority populations are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage disease than are Whites. Progress in reducing the burden of suffering and death from cancer can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population. © American Cancer Society, Inc., 2005.",,"adolescent; adult; African American; aged; article; biostatistics; breast cancer; cancer classification; cancer epidemiology; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer research; cancer staging; cancer statistics; cancer survival; Caucasian; child; colorectal cancer; ethnology; female; geographic distribution; groups by age; hematologic malignancy; human; lung cancer; male; medical society; population distribution; population research; priority journal; prostate cancer; race difference; sex difference; statistical analysis; statistical significance; survival rate; United States; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cause of Death; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Neoplasms; Sex Distribution; Survival Rate; United States",,,,,,"(2004), http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss.htm, National Center for Health Statistics, Division of Vital Statistics.

The formerly HPV-negative cases from this study have therefore been reanalysed for HPV serum antibodies and HPV DNA. Serology for HPV 16 VLPs, E6, and E7 antibodies was performed on 49 of the 66 cases which were HPV-negative and a sample of 48 of the 866 cases which were HPV-positive in the original study. Moreover, 55 of the 66 formerly HPV-negative biopsies were also reanalysed by a sandwich procedure in which the outer sections in a series of sections are used for histological review, while the inner sections are assayed by three different HPV PCR assays targeting different open reading frames (ORFs). No significant difference was found in serology for HPV 16 proteins between the cases that were originally HPV PCR-negative and -positive. Type-specific E7 PCR for 14 high-risk HPV types detected HPV DNA in 38 (69 per cent) of the 55 originally HPV-negative and amplifiable specimens. The HPV types detected were 16, 18, 31, 33, 39, 45, 52, and 58. Two (4 per cent) additional cases were only HPV DNA-positive by E1 and/or L1 consensus PCR. Histological analysis of the 55 specimens revealed that 21 were qualitatively inadequate. Only two of the 34 adequate samples were HPV-negative on all PCR tests, as against 13 of the 21 that were inadequate (p<0.001). Combining the data from this and the previous study and excluding inadequate specimens, the worldwide HPV prevalence in cervical carcinomas is 99.7 per cent. The presence of HPV in virtually all cervical cancers implies the highest worldwide attributable fraction so far reported for a specific cause of any major human cancer. The extreme rarity of HPV-negative cancers reinforces the rationale for HPV testing in addition to, or even instead of, cervical cytology in routine cervical screening.","Cervical carcinoma; Epidemiology; Histology; HPV PCR; HPV serology","virus DNA; article; cancer screening; controlled study; female; histology; human; human cell; human tissue; invasive carcinoma; major clinical study; open reading frame; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; serology; uterine cervix cancer; uterine cervix cytology; wart virus; Biology; Cancer; Cervical Cancer; Clinical Research; Diseases; Epidemiology; Examinations And Diagnoses; Health; Histology; Hpv; Laboratory Examinations And Diagnoses; Laboratory Procedures; Neoplasms; Public Health; Research Methodology; Research Report; Viral Diseases; World; Antibodies, Viral; Base Sequence; Blotting, Southern; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cervix Uteri; DNA Primers; DNA, Viral; Female; Humans; Molecular Sequence Data; Oncogene Proteins, Viral; Papillomaviridae; Paraffin Embedding; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Prevalence; Repressor Proteins; Sensitivity and Specificity; Statistics, Nonparametric; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; World Health",,"Antibodies, Viral; DNA Primers; DNA, Viral; E6 protein, Human papillomavirus type 16; oncogene protein E7, Human papillomavirus type 16; Oncogene Proteins, Viral; Repressor Proteins",,,,"Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans (1995) Human Papillomaviruses, 64. , Human Papillomaviruses Lyon: International Agency for Research on Cancer; Bosch, F.X., Manos, M.M., Muñoz, N., Prevalence of human papillomavirus in cervical cancer: A worldwide perspective (1995) J Natl Cancer Inst, 87, pp. 796-802; Walboomers, J.M.M., Cjlm, M., Do HPV-negative cervical carcinomas exist?

The test statistic is a direct statistical analogue of the popular 'funnel-graph.' The number of component studies in the meta-analysis, the nature of the selection mechanism, the range of variances of the effect size estimates, and the true underlying effect size are all observed to be influential in determining the power of the test. The test is fairly powerful for large meta-analyses with 75 component studies, but has only moderate power for meta-analyses with 25 component studies. However, in many of the configurations in which there is low power, there is also relatively little bias in the summary effect size estimate. Nonetheless, the test must be interpreted with caution in small meta-analyses. In particular, bias cannot be ruled out if the test is not significant. The proposed technique has potential utility as an exploratory tool for meta-analysts, as a formal procedure to complement the funnel- graph.","Meta-analysis; Publication bias; Rank correlation","analytic method; article; cancer risk; chlamydia trachomatis; human; lung cancer; mathematical computing; meta analysis; oral contraception; passive smoking; publication; statistical analysis; Bias (Epidemiology); Case-Control Studies; Chlamydia Infections; Chlorine; Comparative Study; Contraceptives, Oral; Female; Human; Lung Neoplasms; Mathematics; Meta-Analysis; Models, Statistical; Neoplasms; Odds Ratio; Publishing; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Tobacco Smoke Pollution; Water Supply; Chlamydia trachomatis",,"Chlorine, 7782-50-5; Contraceptives, Oral",,,,,"Begg, C.B.; Dept. of Epidemiology/Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Can.

The HER-2/neu proto-oncogene is amplified in 25 to 30 percent of human primary breast cancers and this alteration is associated with disease behavior. In this report, several similarities were found in the biology of HER-2/neu in breast and ovarian cancer, including a similar incidence of amplification, a direct correlation between amplification and over-expression, evidence of tumors in which overexpression occurs without amplification, and the association between gene alteration and clinical outcome. A comprehensive study of the gene and its products (RNA and protein) was simultaneously performed on a large number of both tumor types. This analysis identified several potential shortcomings of the various methods used to evaluate HER-2/neu in these diseases (Southern, Northern, and Western blots, and immunohistochemistry) and provided information regarding considerations that should be addressed when studying a gene or gene product in human tissue. The data presented further support the concept that the HER-2/neu gene may be involved in the pathogenesis of some human cancers.",,"breast cancer; carcinogenesis; gene amplification; histochemistry; histology; human; human cell; immunoblotting; immunohistochemistry; methodology; ovary cancer; priority journal; proto oncogene; Animal; Breast Neoplasms; Cloning, Molecular; Comparative Study; DNA; Female; Gene Amplification; Gene Expression Regulation; Human; Immunohistochemistry; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; Ovarian Neoplasms; Prognosis; Protein Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; Proto-Oncogenes; Receptor, erbB-2; RNA; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Tumor Markers, Biological",,"DNA, 9007-49-2; Protein Kinases, EC 2.7.1.37; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; Receptor, erbB-2, EC 2.7.1.112; RNA, 63231-63-0; Tumor Markers, Biological",,,,,"Slamon, D.J.; Department of Medicine, Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, U.C.L.A.

Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard million population. A total of 1,399,790 new cancer cases and 564,830 deaths from cancer are expected in the United States in 2006. When deaths are aggregated by age, cancer has surpassed heart disease as the leading cause of death for those younger than age 85 since 1999. Delay-adjusted cancer incidence rates stabilized in men from 1995 through 2002, but continued to increase by 0.3% per year from 1987 through 2002 in women. Between 2002 and 2003, the actual number of recorded cancer deaths decreased by 778 in men, but increased by 409 in women, resulting in a net decrease of 369, the first decrease in the total number of cancer deaths since national mortality record keeping was instituted in 1930. The death rate from all cancers combined has decreased by 1.5% per year since 1993 among men and by 0.8% per year since 1992 among women. The mortality rate has also continued to decrease for the three most common cancer sites in men (lung and bronchus, colon and rectum, and prostate) and for breast and colon and rectum cancers in women. Lung cancer mortality among women continues to increase slightly. In analyses by race and ethnicity, African American men and women have 40% and 18% higher death rates from all cancers combined than White men and women, respectively. Cancer incidence and death rates are lower in other racial and ethnic groups than in Whites and African Americans for all sites combined and for the four major cancer sites. However, these groups generally have higher rates for stomach, liver, and cervical cancers than Whites. Furthermore, minority populations are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage disease than are Whites. Progress in reducing the burden of suffering and death from cancer can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population. © American Cancer Society, Inc., 2006.",,"breast cancer; bronchus cancer; cancer; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer statistics; cancer survival; colon cancer; ethnic difference; human; liver cancer; lung cancer; population research; priority journal; prostate cancer; rectum cancer; review; statistical analysis; stomach cancer; United States; uterine cervix cancer; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; Continental Population Groups; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Sex Distribution; Survival Rate; United States",,,,,,"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss.htm(2004) SEER*Stat Database: Incidence - SEER 9 Regs Public-Use, Nov 2004 Sub (1973-2002), , www.seer.cancer.gov, National Cancer Institute, DCCPS, Surveillance Research Program, Cancer Statistics Branch, released April based on the November submission; SEER Cancer Statistics Review, 1975-2002, , http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2002/, Ries LAG, Eisner MP, Kosary CL, et al.

ROS and RNS are normally generated by tightly regulated enzymes, such as NO synthase (NOS) and NAD(P)H oxidase isoforms, respectively. Overproduction of ROS (arising either from mitochondrial electron-transport chain or excessive stimulation of NAD(P)H) results in oxidative stress, a deleterious process that can be an important mediator of damage to cell structures, including lipids and membranes, proteins, and DNA. In contrast, beneficial effects of ROS/RNS (e.g. superoxide radical and nitric oxide) occur at low/moderate concentrations and involve physiological roles in cellular responses to noxia, as for example in defence against infectious agents, in the function of a number of cellular signalling pathways, and the induction of a mitogenic response. Ironically, various ROS-mediated actions in fact protect cells against ROS-induced oxidative stress and re-establish or maintain ""redox balance"" termed also ""redox homeostasis"". The ""two-faced"" character of ROS is clearly substantiated. For example, a growing body of evidence shows that ROS within cells act as secondary messengers in intracellular signalling cascades which induce and maintain the oncogenic phenotype of cancer cells, however, ROS can also induce cellular senescence and apoptosis and can therefore function as anti-tumourigenic species. This review will describe the: (i) chemistry and biochemistry of ROS/RNS and sources of free radical generation; (ii) damage to DNA, to proteins, and to lipids by free radicals; (iii) role of antioxidants (e.g. glutathione) in the maintenance of cellular ""redox homeostasis""; (iv) overview of ROS-induced signaling pathways; (v) role of ROS in redox regulation of normal physiological functions, as well as (vi) role of ROS in pathophysiological implications of altered redox regulation (human diseases and ageing). Attention is focussed on the ROS/RNS-linked pathogenesis of cancer, cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, hypertension, ischemia/reperfusion injury, diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease), rheumatoid arthritis, and ageing. Topics of current debate are also reviewed such as the question whether excessive formation of free radicals is a primary cause or a downstream consequence of tissue injury. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Since RECIST was published in 2000, many investigators, cooperative groups, industry and government authorities have adopted these criteria in the assessment of treatment outcomes. However, a number of questions and issues have arisen which have led to the development of a revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1). Evidence for changes, summarised in separate papers in this special issue, has come from assessment of a large data warehouse (>6500 patients), simulation studies and literature reviews. Highlights of revised RECIST 1.1: Major changes include: Number of lesions to be assessed: based on evidence from numerous trial databases merged into a data warehouse for analysis purposes, the number of lesions required to assess tumour burden for response determination has been reduced from a maximum of 10 to a maximum of five total (and from five to two per organ, maximum). Assessment of pathological lymph nodes is now incorporated: nodes with a short axis of ≥15 mm are considered measurable and assessable as target lesions. The short axis measurement should be included in the sum of lesions in calculation of tumour response. Nodes that shrink to <10 mm short axis are considered normal. Confirmation of response is required for trials with response primary endpoint but is no longer required in randomised studies since the control arm serves as appropriate means of interpretation of data. Disease progression is clarified in several aspects: in addition to the previous definition of progression in target disease of 20% increase in sum, a 5 mm absolute increase is now required as well to guard against over calling PD when the total sum is very small. Furthermore, there is guidance offered on what constitutes 'unequivocal progression' of non-measurable/non-target disease, a source of confusion in the original RECIST guideline. Finally, a section on detection of new lesions, including the interpretation of FDG-PET scan assessment is included. Imaging guidance: the revised RECIST includes a new imaging appendix with updated recommendations on the optimal anatomical assessment of lesions. Future work: A key question considered by the RECIST Working Group in developing RECIST 1.1 was whether it was appropriate to move from anatomic unidimensional assessment of tumour burden to either volumetric anatomical assessment or to functional assessment with PET or MRI. It was concluded that, at present, there is not sufficient standardisation or evidence to abandon anatomical assessment of tumour burden. The only exception to this is in the use of FDG-PET imaging as an adjunct to determination of progression.

Incidence data were collected by the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. A total of 1,665,540 new cancer cases and 585,720 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States in 2014. During the most recent 5 years for which there are data (2006-2010), delay-adjusted cancer incidence rates declined slightly in men (by 0.6% per year) and were stable in women, while cancer death rates decreased by 1.8% per year in men and by 1.4% per year in women. The combined cancer death rate (deaths per 100,000 population) has been continuously declining for 2 decades, from a peak of 215.1 in 1991 to 171.8 in 2010. This 20% decline translates to the avoidance of approximately 1,340,400 cancer deaths (952,700 among men and 387,700 among women) during this time period. The magnitude of the decline in cancer death rates from 1991 to 2010 varies substantially by age, race, and sex, ranging from no decline among white women aged 80 years and older to a 55% decline among black men aged 40 years to 49 years. Notably, black men experienced the largest drop within every 10-year age group. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population.

We describe a new method, MSP (methylation-specific PCR), which can rapidly assess the methylation status of virtually any group of CpG sites within a CpG island, independent of the use of methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes. This assay entails initial modification of DNA by sodium bisulfite, converting all unmethylated, but not methylated, cytosines to uracil, and subsequent amplification with primers specific for methylated versus unmethylated DNA. MSP requires only small quantities of DNA, is sensitive to 0.1% methylated alleles of a given CpG island locus, and can be performed on DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded samples. MSP eliminates the false positive results inherent to previous PCR- based approaches which relied on differential restriction enzyme cleavage to distinguish methylated from unmethylated DNA. In this study, we demonstrate the use of MSP to identify promoter region hypermethylation changes associated with transcriptional inactivation in four important tumor suppressor genes (p16, p15, E-cadherin, and von Hippel-Lindau) in human cancer.","DNA methylation; p15; p16; tumor suppressor genes","bisulfite; dinucleotide; dna; uvomorulin; article; binding site; controlled study; diagnostic procedure; dna determination; dna methylation; enzyme assay; human; human cell; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; promoter region; tumor suppressor gene; Antisense Elements (Genetics); Base Sequence; Cadherins; Carrier Proteins; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Line; CpG Islands; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16; DNA Primers; Genes, Tumor Suppressor; Humans; Ligases; Methylation; Molecular Sequence Data; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Proteins; Restriction Mapping; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases; Von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor Protein","GENBANK: L34545, S75756, U12818, U19763, X94154","Antisense Elements (Genetics); Cadherins; Carrier Proteins; CDKN2B protein, human; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16; DNA Primers; Ligases, EC 6.-; Proteins; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases, EC 6.3.2.19; VHL protein, human, EC 6.3.2.19; Von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor Protein, EC 6.3.2.19",,,,"Holliday, R., Grigg, G.W., (1993) Mutat.

Rates and patterns of ill health are determined by factors such as socioeconomic development, educational attainment, technological developments, and their dispersion among populations, as well as exposure to hazards such as tobacco. As part of the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD), we developed three scenarios of future mortality and disability for different age-sex groups, causes, and regions. Methods: We used the most important disease and injury trends since 1950 in nine cause-of-death clusters. Regression equations for mortality rates for each cluster by region were developed from gross domestic product per person (in international dollars), average number of years of education, time (in years, as a surrogate for technological change), and smoking intensity, which shows the cumulative effects based on data for 47 countries in 1950-90. Optimistic, pessimistic, and baseline projections of the independent variables were made. We related mortality from detailed causes to mortality from a cause cluster to project more detailed causes. Based on projected numbers of deaths by cause, years of life lived with disability (YLDs) were projected from different relation models of YLDs to years of life lost (YLLs). Population projections were prepared from World Bank projections of fertility and the projected mortality rates. Findings: Life expectancy at birth for women was projected to increase in all three scenarios; in established market economies to about 90 years by 2020. Far smaller gains in male life expectancy were projected than in females; in formerly socialist economies of Europe, male life expectancy may not increase at all. Worldwide mortality from communicable maternal, perinatal, and nutritional disorders was expected to decline in the baseline scenario from 17.2 million deaths in 1990 to 10.3 million in 2020. We projected that non-communicable disease mortality will increase from 28.1 million deaths in 1990 to 49.7 million in 2020. Deaths from injury may increase from 5.1 million to 8.4 million. Leading causes of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) predicted by the baseline model were (in descending order): ischaemic heart disease, unipolar major depression, road-traffic accidents, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower respiratory infections, tuberculosis, war injuries, diarrhoeal diseases, and HIV. Tobacco-attributable mortality is projected to increase from 3.0 million deaths in 1990 to 8.4 million deaths in 2020. Interpretation: Health trends in the next 25 years will be determined mainly by the ageing of the world's population, the decline in age-specific mortality rates from communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional disorders, the spread of HIV, and the increase in tobacco-related mortality and disability. Projections, by their nature, are highly uncertain, but we found some robust results with implications for health policy.As part of the Global Burden of Disease Study, three scenarios of future mortality and disability were identified. The scenarios were based on future health status as a function of projected changes in key socioeconomic variables that influence health status. Regression equations for mortality rates for nine cause-of-death clusters were developed by region based on gross domestic product per person, average number of years of education, time (as a proxy for technological change), and smoking intensity. Life expectancy at birth was projected, in all three scenarios, to increase for women (to about 90 years in established market economies by 2020), with far smaller gains in male life expectancy. Worldwide, annual mortality from communicable maternal, perinatal, and nutritional disorders (group 1 causes) is expected to decline from 17.2 million to 10.3 million in 2020 in the baseline model. Also expected is a very large increase in deaths from non-communicable diseases (group 2 causes) from 28.1 million in 1990 to 49.7 million in 2020. Deaths from injuries (group 3) are projected to increase from 5.1 million to 8.4 million. Diarrheal diseases, perinatal disorders, measles, and malaria are expected to decline dramatically as causes of death in the 1990-2020 period, while lung cancer, stomach cancer, war injuries, liver cancer, and HIV are expected to move up five or more places in the ranking. In 2020, the 10 leading causes of disability-adjusted life-years (in descending order) are projected to be ischemic heart disease, unipolar major depression, road traffic accidents, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower respiratory infections, tuberculosis, war injuries, diarrheal diseases, and HIV. Tobacco-attributable mortality is projected to increase from 3.0 million in 1990 to 8.4 million in 2020 (9% of the worldwide mortality burden).",,"article; battle injury; cerebrovascular disease; chronic obstructive lung disease; communicable disease; decision making; depression; diarrhea; disability; education; epidemiology; Europe; fertility; health care policy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; injury; ischemic heart disease; life expectancy; lower respiratory tract infection; maternal disease; medical research; mortality; nutritional disorder; perinatal morbidity; prediction; priority journal; regression analysis; sex difference; smoking; socioeconomics; tobacco; traffic accident; training; tuberculosis; Behavior; Biology; Causes Of Death; Chronic Diseases; Communicable Diseases; Demographic Factors; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Diseases; Infections; Length Of Life; Life Expectancy--changes; Mortality; Mortality Determinants; Population; Population Dynamics; Research Methodology; Research Report; Risk Factors; Smoking; Statistical Studies; Studies; World; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Cause of Death; Child; Child, Preschool; Cluster Analysis; Disabled Persons; Educational Status; Environmental Exposure; Female; Forecasting; Health Personnel; Humans; Investments; Life Expectancy; Male; Middle Aged; Morbidity; Mortality; Population Dynamics; Regression Analysis; Research; Sex Factors; Smoking; Socioeconomic Factors; Survival Rate; Technology; United States; Value of Life; Wounds and Injuries",,,,,,"Bezold, C., Health care: Thinking ahead (1994) World Health Forum, 15, pp. 189-192; Garrett, M.J., A way through the maze: What futurists do and how they do it (1993) Futures, 25, pp. 254-274; Taket, A., (1993) Health Futures in Support of Health for All: Report of an International Consultation Convened by the World Health Organization, , Geneva, 19-23 July, 1993.

Recent studies have reported associations between particulate air pollution and daily mortality rates. Population-based, cross-sectional studies of metropolitan areas in the United States have also found associations between particulate air pollution and annual mortality rates, but these studies have been criticized, in part because they did not directly control for cigarette smoking and other health risks. Methods. In this prospective cohort study, we estimated the effects of air pollution on mortality, while controlling for individual risk factors. Survival analysis, including Cox proportional-hazards regression modeling, was conducted with data from a 14-to-16-year mortality follow-up of 8111 adults in six U.S. cities. Results. Mortality rates were most strongly associated with cigarette smoking. After adjusting for smoking and other risk factors, we observed statistically significant and robust associations between air pollution and mortality. The adjusted mortality-rate ratio for the most polluted of the cities as compared with the least polluted was 1.26 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.47). Air pollution was positively associated with death from lung cancer and cardiopulmonary disease but not with death from other causes considered together. Mortality was most strongly associated with air pollution with fine particulates, including sulfates. Conclusions. Although the effects of other, unmeasured risk factors cannot be excluded with certainty, these results suggest that fine-particulate air pollution, or a more complex pollution mixture associated with fine particulate matter, contributes to excess mortality in certain U.S. cities.",,"adult; aged; air pollution; air quality; article; cancer mortality; cancer risk; cancer survival; cause of death; cigarette smoking; disease association; follow up; human; lung cancer; major clinical study; mortality; particulate matter; priority journal; regression analysis; statistical analysis; united states; Adult; Aged; Air Pollution; Cause of Death; Confidence Intervals; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Smoking; Survival Analysis; United States; Urban Health",,,,,,,"Dockery, D.W.; Environmental Epidemiology Program, Department of Environmental Health, Harvard School of Public Health, 665 Huntington Ave., Boston, MA 02115, United States",,,,,,,,00284793,,NEJMA,8179653,"English","NEW ENGL.

Oxidant by- products of normal metabolism cause extensive damage to DNA, protein, and lipid. We argue that this damage (the same as that produced by radiation) is a major contributor to aging and to degenerative diseases of aging such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, immune-system decline, brain dysfunction, and cataracts. Antioxidant defenses against this damage include ascorbate, tocopherol, and carotenoids. Dietary fruits and vegetables are the principal source of ascorbate and carotenoids and are one source of tocopherol. Low dietary intake of fruits and vegetables doubles the risk of most types of cancer as compared to high intake and also markedly increases the risk of heart disease and cataracts.

A preliminary study suggested that sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and Raf may be effective in hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: In this multicenter, phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 602 patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who had not received previous systemic treatment to receive either sorafenib (at a dose of 400 mg twice daily) or placebo. Primary outcomes were overall survival and the time to symptomatic progression. Secondary outcomes included the time to radiologic progression and safety. RESULTS: At the second planned interim analysis, 321 deaths had occurred, and the study was stopped. Median overall survival was 10.7 months in the sorafenib group and 7.9 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the sorafenib group, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.55 to 0.87; P<0.001). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the median time to symptomatic progression (4.1 months vs. 4.9 months, respectively, P = 0.77). The median time to radiologic progression was 5.5 months in the sorafenib group and 2.8 months in the placebo group (P<0.001). Seven patients in the sorafenib group (2%) and two patients in the placebo group (1%) had a partial response; no patients had a complete response. Diarrhea, weight loss, hand-foot skin reaction, and hypophosphatemia were more frequent in the sorafenib group. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, median survival and the time to radiologic progression were nearly 3 months longer for patients treated with sorafenib than for those given placebo.

We looked for four genetic alterations (ras-gene mutations and allelic deletions of chromosomes 5, 17, and 18) in 172 colorectal-tumor specimens representing various stages of neoplastic development. The specimens consisted of 40 predominantly early-stage adenomas from 7 patients with familial ademonatous polyposis, 40 adenomas (19 without associated foci of carcinoma and 21 with such foci) from 33 patients without familial polyposis, and 92 carcinomas resected from 89 patients. We found that ras-gene mutations in 58 percent of ademonas larger than 1 cm and in 47 percent of carcinomas. However, ras mutations were found in only 9 percent of adenomas under 1 cm in size. Sequences on chromosome 5 that are linked to the gene for familial ademonatous polyposis were not lost in adenomas from the patients with polyposis but were lost in 29 to 35 percent of adenomas and carcinomas, respectively, from other patients. A specific region of chromosome 18 was deleted frequently in carcinomas (73 percent) and in advenced adenomas (47 percent) but only occasionally in earlier-stage adenomas (11 to 13 percent). Chromosome 17p sequences were usually lost only in carcinomas (75 percent). The four molecular alterations accumulated in a fashion that paralleled the clinical progression of tumors. These results are consistent with a model of colorectal tumorigenesis in which the steps required for the development of cancer often involve the mutational activation of an oncogene coupled with the loss of several genes that normally suppress tumorigenesis.",,"adenoma; adult; carcinoma; chromosome; colorectal cancer; colorectal tumor; female; gene mutation; heredity; major clinical study; male; priority journal; Adenoma; Adenomatous Polyposis Coli; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alleles; Carcinoma; Chromosome Deletion; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5; Colonic Neoplasms; Colorectal Neoplasms, Hereditary Nonpolyposis; Female; Genes, ras; Human; Male; Middle Age; Mutation; Rectal Neoplasms; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00284793,,NEJMA,2841597,"English","NEW ENGL.

Here, we report the 10-year and 15-year effects. Methods: Collaborative meta-analyses were undertaken of 194 unconfounded randomised trials of adjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy that began by 1995. Many trials involved CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil), anthracycline-based combinations such as FAC (fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide) or FEC (fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide), tamoxifen, or ovarian suppression: none involved taxanes, trastuzumab, raloxifene, or modern aromatase inhibitors. Findings: Allocation to about 6 months of anthracycline-based polychemotherapy (eg, with FAC or FEC) reduces the annual breast cancer death rate by about 38% (SE 5) for women younger than 50 years of age when diagnosed and by about 20% (SE 4) for those of age 50-69 years when diagnosed, largely irrespective of the use of tamoxifen and of oestrogen receptor (ER) status, nodal status, or other tumour characteristics. Such regimens are significantly (2p=0·0001 for recurrence, 2p<0·00001 for breast cancer mortality) more effective than CMF chemotherapy. Few women of age 70 years or older entered these chemotherapy trials. For ER-positive disease only, allocation to about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen reduces the annual breast cancer death rate by 31% (SE 3), largely irrespective of the use of chemotherapy and of age (<50, 50-69, ≥70 years), progesterone receptor status, or other tumour characteristics. 5 years is significantly (2p<0·00001 for recurrence, 2p=0·01 for breast cancer mortality) more effective than just 1-2 years of tamoxifen. For ER-positive tumours, the annual breast cancer mortality rates are similar during years 0-4 and 5-14, as are the proportional reductions in them by 5 years of tamoxifen, so the cumulative reduction in mortality is more than twice as big at 15 years as at 5 years after diagnosis. These results combine six meta-analyses: anthracycline-based versus no chemotherapy (8000 women); CMF-based versus no chemotherapy (14 000); anthracycline-based versus CMF-based chemotherapy (14 000); about 5 years of tamoxifen versus none (15 000); about 1-2 years of tamoxifen versus none (33 000); and about 5 years versus 1-2 years of tamoxifen (18 000). Finally, allocation to ovarian ablation or suppression (8000 women) also significantly reduces breast cancer mortality, but appears to do so only in the absence of other systemic treatments. For middle-aged women with ER-positive disease (the commonest type of breast cancer), the breast cancer mortality rate throughout the next 15 years would be approximately halved by 6 months of anthracycline-based chemotherapy (with a combination such as FAC or FEC) followed by 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. For, if mortality reductions of 38% (age <50 years) and 20% (age 50-69 years) from such chemotherapy were followed by a further reduction of 31% from tamoxifen in the risks that remain, the final mortality reductions would be 57% and 45%, respectively (and, the trial results could well have been somewhat stronger if there had been full compliance with the allocated treatments). Overall survival would be comparably improved, since these treatments have relatively small effects on mortality from the aggregate of all other causes. Interpretation: Some of the widely practicable adjuvant drug treatments that were being tested in the 1980s, which substantially reduced 5-year recurrence rates (but had somewhat less effect on 5-year mortality rates), also substantially reduce 15-year mortality rates. Further improvements in long-term survival could well be available from newer drugs, or better use of older drugs.",,"anthracycline derivative; cyclophosphamide; cytotoxic agent; doxorubicin; epirubicin; estrogen receptor; fluorouracil; gonadorelin antagonist; melphalan; methotrexate; progesterone receptor; tamoxifen; vincristine; aromatase inhibitor; cyclophosphamide; doxorubicin; epirubicin; fluorouracil; methotrexate; raloxifene; tamoxifen; taxane derivative; trastuzumab; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer recurrence; cancer risk; cancer survival; cardiotoxicity; clinical trial; comparative study; drug induced cancer; electrosurgery; follow up; hormonal therapy; human; intermethod comparison; meta analysis; patient compliance; priority journal; recurrence risk; review; risk reduction; statistical analysis; statistical significance; treatment outcome; Article; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer hormone therapy; cancer recurrence; cancer survival; early cancer; overall survival; systematic review; systemic therapy; Aged; Anthracyclines; Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Breast Neoplasms; Cause of Death; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Ovariectomy; Ovary; Randomized Controlled Trials; Receptors, Estrogen; Survival Rate; Tamoxifen",,"cyclophosphamide, 50-18-0; doxorubicin, 23214-92-8, 25316-40-9; epirubicin, 56390-09-1, 56420-45-2; fluorouracil, 51-21-8; melphalan, 148-82-3; methotrexate, 15475-56-6, 59-05-2, 7413-34-5; tamoxifen, 10540-29-1; vincristine, 57-22-7; raloxifene, 82640-04-8, 84449-90-1; trastuzumab, 180288-69-1; Anthracyclines; Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal; Receptors, Estrogen; Tamoxifen, 10540-29-1",,,,"Review of mortality results in randomised trials in early breast cancer (1984) Lancet, 2, p. 1205. , Anon; Effects of adjuvant tamoxifen and of cytotoxic therapy on mortality in early breast cancer: An overview of 61 randomised trials among 28 896 women (1988) N Engl J Med, 319, pp. 1681-1692. , Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group; (1990) Treatment of Early Breast Cancer, Vol 1: Worldwide Evidence, 1985-1990, , Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group Oxford University Press Oxford; Systemic treatment of early breast cancer by hormonal, cytotoxic, or immune therapy: 133 randomised trials involving 31 000 recurrences and 24 000 deaths among 75 000 women (1992) Lancet, 339, pp. 1-15. , Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group; Systemic treatment of early breast cancer by hormonal, cytotoxic, or immune therapy: 133 randomised trials involving 31 000 recurrences and 24 000 deaths among 75 000 women (1992) Lancet, 339, pp. 71-85. , Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group; Effects of radiotherapy and surgery in early breast cancer: An overview of the randomised trials (1995) N Engl J Med, 333, pp. 1444-1455. , Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group; Ovarian ablation in early breast cancer: Overview of the randomised trials (1996) Lancet, 348, pp. 1189-1196. , Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group; Tamoxifen for early breast cancer: An overview of the randomised trials (1998) Lancet, 351, pp. 1451-1467. , Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group; Polychemotherapy for early breast cancer: An overview of the randomised trials (1998) Lancet, 352, pp. 930-942. , Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group; Favourable and unfavourable effects on long-term survival of radiotherapy for early breast cancer: An overview of the randomised trials (2000) Lancet, 355, pp. 1757-1770. , Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group; Peto, R., Pike, M.C., Armitage, P., Design and analysis of randomised clinical trials requiring prolonged observation of each patient, part II: Analysis and examples (1977) Br J Cancer, 35, pp. 1-39; Collins, R., Peto, R., Gray, R., Parish, S., Large-scale randomised evidence: Trials and overviews (2003) Oxford Textbook of Medicine, pp. 24-36. , D.A.

In contrast, mammalian DNA has a low frequency of CpG dinucleotides, and these are mostly methylated; therefore, mammalian DNA does not have immuno-stimulatory activity. CpG DNA induces a strong T-helper-1-like inflammatory response. Accumulating evidence has revealed the therapeutic potential of CpG DNA as adjuvants for vaccination strategies for cancer, allergy and infectious diseases. Despite its promising clinical use, the molecular mechanism by which CpG DNA activates immune cells remains unclear. Here we show that cellular response to CpG DNA is mediated by a Toll-like receptor, TLR9. TLR9-defident (TLR9-/-) mice did not show any response to CpG DNA, including proliferation of splenocytes, inflammatory cytokine production from macrophages and maturation of dendritic cells. TLR9-/- mice showed resistance to the lethal effect of CpG DNA without any elevation of serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. The in vivo CpG-DNA-mediated T-helper type-1 response was also abolished in TLR9-/- mice. Thus, vertebrate immune systems appear to have evolved a specific Toll-like receptor that distinguishes bacterial DNA from self-DNA.",,"bacterial DNA; dinucleotide; toll like receptor; allergy; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; article; cancer; cell maturation; cell proliferation; controlled study; cytokine production; dendritic cell; immune response; immune system; immunocompetent cell; immunostimulation; infection; inflammation; macrophage; mouse; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; spleen cell; Th1 cell; vaccination; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Antigens, Differentiation; Base Sequence; Cells, Cultured; Cloning, Molecular; Cytokines; Dendritic Cells; Dinucleoside Phosphates; DNA, Bacterial; DNA-Binding Proteins; Drosophila Proteins; Humans; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis; Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88; Receptors, Cell Surface; Receptors, Immunologic; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Signal Transduction; T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer; Toll-Like Receptor 9; Toll-Like Receptors","GENBANK: AA273731, AB045180, AB045181, AF240467, AF246971","Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Antigens, Differentiation; cytidylyl-3'-5'-guanosine, 2382-65-2; Cytokines; Dinucleoside Phosphates; DNA, Bacterial; DNA-Binding Proteins; Drosophila Proteins; Membrane Glycoproteins; MYD88 protein, human; Myd88 protein, mouse; Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88; Receptors, Cell Surface; Receptors, Immunologic; TLR9 protein, human; Tlr9 protein, mouse; Toll-Like Receptor 9; Toll-Like Receptors",,,,"Krieg, A.M., Lymphocyte activation by CpG dinucleotide motifs in prokaryotic DNA (1996) Trends Microbiol., 4, pp. 73-76; Lipford, G.B., Heeg, K., Wagner, H., Bacterial DNA as immune cell activator (1998) Trends Microbiol., 6, pp. 496-500; Yamamoto, S., Yamamoto, T., Tokunaga, T., The discovery of immunostimulatory DNA sequence (2000) Spring.

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a strong independent indicator of risk of cardiovascular morbidity and death. We aimed to establish whether selective blocking of angiotensin II improves LVH beyond reducing blood pressure and, consequently, reduces cardiovascular morbidity and death. Methods: We did a double-masked, randomised, parallel-group trial in 9193 participants aged 55-80 years with essential hypertension (sitting blood pressure 160-200/95-115 mm Hg) and LVH ascertained by electrocardiography (ECG). We assigned participants once daily losartan-based or atenolol-based antihypertensive treatment for at least 4 years and until 1040 patients had a primary cardiovascular event (death, myocardial infarction, or stroke). We used Cox regression analysis to compare regimens. Findings: Blood pressure fell by 30.2/16.6 (SD 18.5/10.1) and 29.1/16.8 mm Hg (19.2/10.1) in the losartan and atenolol groups, respectively. The primary composite endpoint occurred in 508 losartan (23.8 per 1000 patient-years) and 588 atenolol patients (27.9 per 1000 patient-years; relative risk 0.87, 95% CI 0.77-0.98, p=0.021). 204 losartan and 234 atenolol patients died from cardiovascular disease (0.89, 0.73-1.07, p=0.206); 232 and 309, respectively, had fatal or non-fatal stroke (0.75, 0.63-0.89, p=0.001); and myocardial infarction (non-fatal and fatal) occurred in 198 and 188, respectively (1.07, 0.88-1.31, p=0.491). New-onset diabetes was less frequent with losartan. Interpretation: Losartan prevents more cardiovascular morbidity and death than atenolol for a similar reduction in blood pressure and is better tolerated. Losartan seems to confer benefits beyond reduction in blood pressure.",,"angiotensin; atenolol; hydrochlorothiazide; losartan; adult; aged; angioneurotic edema; antihypertensive therapy; article; asthenia;

To test this hypothesis, the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project initiated the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (P-1) in 1992. Methods: Women (N = 13388) at increased risk for breast cancer because they 1) were 60 years of age or older, 2) were 35-59 years of age with a 5-year predicted risk for breast cancer of at least 1.66%, or 3) had a history of lobular carcinoma in situ were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 6707) or 20 mg/day tamoxifen (n = 6681) for 5 years. Gail's algorithm, based on a multivariate logistic regression model using combinations of risk factors, was used to estimate the probability (risk) of occurrence of breast cancer over time. Results: Tamoxifen reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer by 49% (two- sided P<.00001), with cumulative incidence through 69 months of follow-up of 43.4 versus 22.0 per 1000 women in the placebo and tamoxifen groups, respectively. The decreased risk occurred in women aged 49 years or younger (44%), 50-59 years (51%), and 60 years or older (55%); risk was also reduced in women with a history of lobular carcinoma in situ (56%) or atypical hyperplasia (86%) and in those with any category of predicted 5-year risk. Tamoxifen reduced the risk of noninvasive breast cancer by 50% (two-sided P<.002). Tamoxifen reduced the occurrence of estrogen receptor-positive tumors by 69%, but no difference in the occurrence of estrogen receptor- negative tumors was seen. Tamoxifen administration did not alter the average annual rate of ischemic heart disease; however, a reduction in hip, radius (Colles'), and spine fractures was observed. The rate of endometrial cancer was increased in the tamoxifen group (risk ratio = 2.53; 95% confidence interval = 1.35-4.97); this increased risk occurred predominantly in women aged 50 years or older. All endometrial cancers in the tamoxifen group were stage I (localized disease); no endometrial cancer deaths have occurred in this group. No liver cancers or increase in colon, rectal, ovarian, or other tumors was observed in the tamoxifen group. The rates of stroke, pulmonary embolism, and deep-vein thrombosis were elevated in the tamoxifen group; these events occurred more frequently in women aged 50 years or older. Conclusions: Tamoxifen decreases the incidence of invasive and noninvasive breast cancer. Despite side effects resulting from administration of tamoxifen, its use as a breast cancer preventive agent is appropriate in many women at increased risk for the disease.",,"estrogen receptor; placebo; tamoxifen; adult; aged; article; breast cancer; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer prevention; cancer risk; cataract; clinical trial; controlled study; deep vein thrombosis; double blind procedure; endometrium cancer; female; follow up; fracture; human; ischemic heart disease; lung embolism; major clinical study; multicenter study; multivariate analysis; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; risk factor; stroke; Adult; Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal; Breast Neoplasms; Cause of Death; Estrogen Antagonists; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Odds Ratio; Quality of Life; Risk; Risk Factors; Tamoxifen; Treatment Outcome",,"Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal; Estrogen Antagonists; Tamoxifen, 10540-29-1",,,,"Heuson, J.C., Current overview of EORTC clinical trials with tamoxifen (1976) Cancer Treat Rep, 60, pp. 1463-1466; Mouridsen, H., Palshof, T., Patterson, J., Battersby, L., Tamoxifen in advanced breast cancer (1978) Cancer Treat Rev, 5, pp. 131-141; Legha, S.S., Buzdar, A.U., Hortobagyi, G.N., Wiseman, C., Benjamin, R.S., Blumenschein, G.R., Tamoxifen.

Those most similar to Bcl-2 promote cell survival by inhibiting adapters needed for activation of the proteases (caspases) that dismantle the cell. More distant relatives instead promote apoptosis, apparently through mechanisms that include displacing the adapters from the pro-survival proteins. Thus, for many but not all apoptotic signals, the balance between these competing activities determines cell fate. Bcl-2 family members are essential for maintenance of major organ systems, and mutations affecting them are implicated in cancer.",,"caspase; cysteine proteinase; cytoplasm protein; fas antigen; protein bcl 2; unclassified drug; apoptosis; caenorhabditis elegans; carcinogenesis; cell survival; dna damage; enzyme activation; gene mutation; homeostasis; human; nonhuman; priority journal; protein domain; protein family; review; Animals; Apoptosis; Cell Cycle; Cell Survival; Cysteine Endopeptidases; Cytokines; Genes, bcl-2; Humans; Neoplasms; Organelles; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2; Caenorhabditis elegans",,"Cysteine Endopeptidases, EC 3.4.22.-; Cytokines; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2",,,,"Kerr, J.F.R., Wyllie, A.H., Currie, A.R., (1972) Br.

Methods: Using microarray analysis to evaluate our previously established 70-gene prognosis profile, we classified a series of 295 consecutive patients with primary breast carcinomas as having a gene-expression signature associated with either a poor prognosis or a good prognosis. All patients had stage I or II breast cancer and were younger than 53 years old; 151 had lymph-node-negative disease, and 144 had lymphnode-positive disease. We evaluated the predictive power of the prognosis profile using univariable and multivariable statistical analyses. Results: Among the 295 patients, 180 had a poor-prognosis signature and 115 had a good-prognosis signature, and the mean (±SE) overall 10-year survival rates were 54.6±4.4 percent and 94.5±2.6 percent, respectively. At 10 years, the probability of remaining free of distant metastases was 50.6±4.5 percent in the group with a poor-prognosis signature and 85.2±4.3 percent in the group with a good-prognosis signature. The estimated hazard ratio for distant metastases in the group with a poor-prognosis signature, as compared with the group with the good-prognosis signature, was 5.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.9 to 9.0; P<0.001). This ratio remained significant when the groups were analyzed according to lymph-node status. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that the prognosis profile was a strong independent factor in predicting disease outcome. Conclusions: The gene-expression profile we studied is a more powerful predictor of the outcome of disease in young patients with breast cancer than standard systems based on clinical and histologic criteria.

Probable predisposing mutations have been detected in five of eight kindreds presumed to segregate BRCA1 susceptibility alleles. The mutations include an 11-base pair deletion, a 1-base pair insertion, a stop codon, a missense substitution, and an inferred regulatory mutation. The BRCA1 gene is expressed in numerous tissues, including breast and ovary, and encodes a predicted protein of 1863 amino acids. This protein contains a zinc finger domain in its amino-terminal region, but is otherwise unrelated to previously described proteins. Identification of BRCA1 should facilitate early diagnosis of breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility in some individuals as well as a better understanding of breast cancer biology.",,"breast cancer; cancer susceptibility; chromosome 17q; female; gene deletion; gene insertion; gene structure; human; major clinical study; missense mutation; molecular cloning; mutation; ovary cancer; priority journal; review; stop codon; Alleles; Alternative Splicing; Amino Acid Sequence; Animal; BRCA1 Protein; Breast Neoplasms; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17; Female; Genes, Tumor Suppressor; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Germ-Line Mutation; Haplotypes; Human; Lod Score; Male; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Neoplasm Proteins; Ovarian Neoplasms; Pedigree; Phenotype; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Transcription Factors; Zinc Fingers","GENBANK: U14680, U15595, U25750, U25751, U25752, U25753, U25754, U25755, U25756, U25757, U25758, U25759, U25760, U25761, U25762, U25763, U25764, U25765, U25766, U25767, U25768, U25769, U25770, U25771, U25772, U25773, U25774, U25775, U25776, U25777","BRCA1 Protein; Neoplasm Proteins; Transcription Factors",,,,,"Skolnick, M.H.; Department of Medical Informatics, University of Utah Medical Center, Myriad Genetics, Salt Lake City, UT 84108, United States",,,,,,,,00368075,,,7545954,"English",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028113345

M5G 1X8, Canada","The cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis suggests that neoplastic clones are maintained exclusively by a rare fraction of cells with stem cell properties. Although the existence of CSCs in human leukaemia is established, little evidence exists for CSCs in solid tumours, except for breast cancer. Recently, we prospectively isolated a CD133+ cell subpopulation from human brain tumours that exhibited stem cell properties in vitro. However, the true measures of CSCs are their capacity for self renewal and exact recapitulation of the original tumour. Here we report the development of a xenograft assay that identified human brain tumour initiating cells that initiate tumours in vivo. Only the CD133+ brain tumour fraction contains cells that are capable of tumour initiation in NOD-SCID (non-obese diabetic, severe combined immunodeficient) mouse brains. Injection of as few as 100 CD133+ cells produced a tumour that could be serially transplanted and was a phenocopy of the patient's original tumour, whereas injection of 105 CD133 - cells engrafted but did not cause a tumour.

This provides a starting point for comprehensive analysis of protein phosphorylation in normal and disease states, as well as a detailed view of the current state of human genome analysis through a focus on one large gene family. We identify 518 putative protein kinase genes, of which 71 have not previously been reported or described as kinases, and we extend or correct the protein sequences of 56 more kinases. New genes include members of well-studied families as well as previously unidentified families, some of which are conserved in model organisms. Classification and comparison with model organism kinomes identified orthologous groups and highlighted expansions specific to human and other lineages. We also identified 106 protein kinase pseudogenes.

METHODS: Patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small-cell lung cancer, with performance status from 0 to 3, were eligible if they had received one or two prior chemotherapy regimens. The patients were stratified according to center, performance status, response to prior chemotherapy, number of prior regimens, and prior platinum-based therapy and were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive oral erlotinib, at a dose of 150 mg daily, or placebo. RESULTS: The median age of the 731 patients who underwent randomization was 61.4 years; 49 percent had received two prior chemotherapy regimens, and 93 percent had received platinum-based chemotherapy. The response rate was 8.9 percent in the erlotinib group and less than 1 percent in the placebo group (P<0.001); the median duration of the response was 7.9 months and 3.7 months, respectively. Progression-free survival was 2.2 months and 1.8 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.61, adjusted for stratification categories; P<0.001). Overall survival was 6.7 months and 4.7 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.70; P<0.001), in favor of erlotinib. Five percent of patients discontinued erlotinib because of toxic effects. CONCLUSIONS: Erlotinib can prolong survival in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer after first-line or second-line chemotherapy.

Chiles Research Institute, Portland, OR, United States","Background: An improvement in overall survival among patients with metastatic melanoma has been an elusive goal. In this phase 3 study, ipilimumab - which blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 to potentiate an antitumor T-cell response - administered with or without a glycoprotein 100 (gp100) peptide vaccine was compared with gp100 alone in patients with previously treated metastatic melanoma. Methods: A total of 676 HLA-A*0201-positive patients with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma, whose disease had progressed while they were receiving therapy for metastatic disease, were randomly assigned, in a 3:1:1 ratio, to receive ipilimumab plus gp100 (403 patients), ipilimumab alone (137), or gp100 alone (136). Ipilimumab, at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight, was administered with or without gp100 every 3 weeks for up to four treatments (induction). Eligible patients could receive reinduction therapy. The primary end point was overall survival. Results: The median overall survival was 10.0 months among patients receiving ipilimumab plus gp100, as compared with 6.4 months among patients receiving gp100 alone (hazard ratio for death, 0.68; P<0.001). The median overall survival with ipilimumab alone was 10.1 months (hazard ratio for death in the comparison with gp100 alone, 0.66; P=0.003). No difference in overall survival was detected between the ipilimumab groups (hazard ratio with ipilimumab plus gp100, 1.04; P=0.76). Grade 3 or 4 immune-related adverse events occurred in 10 to 15% of patients treated with ipilimumab and in 3% treated with gp100 alone. There were 14 deaths related to the study drugs (2.1%), and 7 were associated with immune-related adverse events. Conclusions: Ipilimumab, with or without a gp100 peptide vaccine, as compared with gp100 alone, improved overall survival in patients with previously treated metastatic melanoma. Adverse events can be severe, long-lasting, or both, but most are reversible with appropriate treatment. (Funded by Medarex and Bristol-Myers Squibb; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00094653.)

But each separate trial has limited power to assess particular outcomes or particular categories of participant. Methods: A prospective meta-analysis of data from 90 056 individuals in 14 randomised trials of statins was done. Weighted estimates were obtained of effects on different clinical outcomes per 1·0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol. Findings: During a mean of 5 years, there were 8186 deaths, 14 348 individuals had major vascular events, and 5103 developed cancer. Mean LDL cholesterol differences at 1 year ranged from 0·35 mmol/L to 1·77 mmol/L (mean 1·09) in these trials. There was a 12% proportional reduction in all-cause mortality per mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol (rate ratio [RR] 0·88, 95% CI 0·84-0·91; p<0·0001). This reflected a 19% reduction in coronary mortality (0·81, 0·76-0·85; p<0·0001), and non-significant reductions in non-coronary vascular mortality (0·93, 0·83-1·03; p=0·2) and non-vascular mortality (0·95, 0·90-1·01; p=0·1). There were corresponding reductions in myocardial infarction or coronary death (0·77, 0·74-0·80; p<0·0001), in the need for coronary revascularisation (0·76, 0·73-0·80; p<0·0001), in fatal or non-fatal stroke (0·83, 0·78-0·88; p<0·0001), and, combining these, of 21% in any such major vascular event (0·79, 0·77-0·81; p<0·0001). The proportional reduction in major vascular events differed significantly (p<0·0001) according to the absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol achieved, but not otherwise. These benefits were significant within the first year, but were greater in subsequent years. Taking all years together, the overall reduction of about one fifth per mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction translated into 48 (95% CI 39-57) fewer participants having major vascular events per 1000 among those with pre-existing CHD at baseline, compared with 25 (19-31) per 1000 among participants with no such history. There was no evidence that statins increased the incidence of cancer overall (1·00, 0·95-1·06; p=0·9) or at any particular site. Interpretation: Statin therapy can safely reduce the 5-year incidence of major coronary events, coronary revascularisation, and stroke by about one fifth per mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol, largely irrespective of the initial lipid profile or other presenting characteristics. The absolute benefit relates chiefly to an individual's absolute risk of such events and to the absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol achieved. These findings reinforce the need to consider prolonged statin treatment with substantial LDL cholesterol reductions in all patients at high risk of any type of major vascular event.",,"atorvastatin; fluindostatin; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; mevinolin; pravastatin; simvastatin; adult; aged; article; cancer; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cardiovascular risk; clinical trial; confidence interval; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; disease course; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug safety; fatality; female; heart death; heart infarction; heart muscle revascularization; high risk patient; human; injury; long term exposure; male; meta analysis; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; respiratory tract disease; rhabdomyolysis; stroke; systematic review; treatment outcome; Cause of Death; Cerebrovascular Accident; Cholesterol, LDL; Coronary Disease; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Hypercholesterolemia; Myocardial Infarction; Randomized Controlled Trials; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome",,"atorvastatin, 134523-00-5, 134523-03-8; fluindostatin, 93957-54-1; mevinolin, 75330-75-5; pravastatin, 81131-74-0; simvastatin, 79902-63-9; Cholesterol, LDL; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors",,,,"Stamler, J., Vaccaro, O., Neaton, J.D., Wentworth, Diabetes, other risk factors, and 12-year cardiovascular mortality for men screened in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (1993) Diabetes Care, 16, pp. 434-444. , The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial Research Group D; Chen, Z., Peto, R., Collins, R., Serum cholesterol concentration and coronary heart disease in population with low cholesterol concentrations (1991) BMJ, 303, pp. 276-282; Rossouw, J.E., Lewis, B., Rifkind, B.M., The value of lowering cholesterol after myocardial infarction (1990) N Engl J Med, 323, pp. 1112-1119; Oliver, M.F., Might treatment of hypercholesterolaemia increase non-cardiac mortality?

The book starts with an overview of research strategies in nutritional epidemiology - still a relatively new discipline that combines the vast knowledge compiled by nutritionists during this century with the methodologies developed by epidemiologists to study the determinants of diseases with multiple etiologies and long latent periods. A major section is devoted to the methods of dietary assessment using data on food intake, biochemical indicators of diet, and measures of body composition and size. The reproducibility and validity of each approach and the implications of measurement error are considered in detail. The analysis, presentation, and interpretation of data from epidemiologic studies of diet and disease are explored in depth. Particular attention is paid to the important influence of total energy intake on findings in such studies. To illustrate methodological issues in nutritional epidemiology, the relationships of dietary factors to the incidence of lung and breast cancer, heart disease, and birth defects are examined in depth. This new edition, in addition to updating existing chapters, includes new chapters on assessment of physical activity, nutrition, and genetic epidemic ology, and the role of nutritional epidemiology in policy. © 2013 by Oxford University Press.

METHODS: In a prospectively studied population of more than 900,000 U.S. adults (404,576 men and 495,477 women) who were free ofcancer at enrollment in 1982, there were 57,145 deaths from cancer during 16 years of follow-up. We examined the relation in men and women between the body-mass index in 1982 and the risk of death from all cancers and from cancers at individual sites, while controlling for other risk factors in multivariate proportional-hazards models. We calculated the proportion of all deaths from cancer that was attributable to overweight and obesity in the U.S. population on the basis of risk estimates from the current study and national estimates of the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the U.S. adult population. RESULTS: The heaviest members of this cohort (those with a body-mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters] ofat least 40) had death rates from all cancers combined that were 52 percent higher (for men) and 62 percent higher (for women) than the rates in men and women of normal weight. For men, the relative risk of death was 1.52 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.13 to 2.05); for women, the relative risk was 1.62 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.40 to 1.87). In both men and women, body-mass index was also significantly associated with higher rates of death due to cancer of the esophagus, colon and rectum, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and kidney; the same was true for death due to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Significant trends of increasing risk with higher body-mass-index values were observed for death from cancers of the stomach and prostate in men and for death from cancers of the breast, uterus, cervix, and ovary in women. On the basis of associations observed in this study, we estimate that current patterns of overweight and obesity in the United States could account for 14 percent of all deaths from cancer in men and 20 percent of those in women. CONCLUSIONS: Increased body weight was associated with increased death rates for all cancers combined and for cancers at multiple specific sites.",,"adult; aged; article; body mass; breast cancer; calculation; cancer mortality; cancer risk; cohort analysis; colon cancer; correlation analysis; esophagus cancer; female; gallbladder cancer; human; kidney cancer; liver cancer; male; multiple myeloma; multivariate analysis; nonbiological model; nonhodgkin lymphoma; obesity; ovary cancer; pancreas cancer; population research; prevalence; priority journal; prospective study; prostate cancer; rectum cancer; risk factor; stomach cancer; United States; uterine cervix cancer; uterus cancer; Adult; Aged; Body Mass Index; Cohort Studies; Confounding Factors (Epidemiology); Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Obesity; Prevalence; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Risk; Risk Factors; United States",,,,,,"Manson, J.E., Willett, W.C., Stampfer, M.J., Body weight and mortality among women (1995) N Engl J Med, 333, pp. 677-685; Willett, W.C., Manson, J.E., Stampfer, M.J., Weight, weight change, and coronary heart disease in women: Risk within the 'normal' weight range (1995) JAMA, 273, pp. 461-465; Stevens, J., Plankey, M.W., Williamson, D.F., The body mass index-mortality relationship in white and African American women (1998) Obes Res, 6, pp. 268-277; Lindsted, K.D., Singh, P.N., Body mass and 26y risk of mortality among men who never smoked: A re-analysis of men from the Adventist Mortality Study (1998) Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord, 22, pp. 544-548; Calle, E.E., Thun, M.J., Petrelli, J.M., Rodriguez, C., Heath C.W., Jr., Body-mass index and mortality in a prospective cohort of U.S. adults (1999) N Engl J Med, 341, pp. 1097-1105; Kopelman, P., Obesity as a medical problem (2000) Nature, 404, pp. 635-643; Lew, E.A., Garfinkel, L., Variations in mortality by weight among 750,000 men and women (1979) J Chronic Dis, 32, pp. 563-576; (1997) Food, Nutrition and the Prevention of Cancer: A Global Perspective, pp. 371-373. , Washington, D.C.: American Institute for Cancer Research; Carroll, K., Obesity as a risk factor for certain types of cancer (1998) Lipids, 33, pp. 1055-1059; Bergstrom, A., Pisani, P., Tenet, V., Wolk, A., Adami, H.-O., Overweight as an avoidable cause of cancer in Europe (2001) Int J Cancer, 91, pp. 421-430. , Erratum, Int J Cancer 2001;92: 927; (2002) IARC Handbooks of Cancer Prevention Vol. 6.

Histological variants were added if there was evidence of a different age distribution, location, genetic profile or clinical behaviour; these included pilomyxoid astrocytoma, anaplastic medulloblastoma and medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity. The WHO grading scheme and the sections on genetic profiles were updated and the rhabdoid tumour predisposition syndrome was added to the list of familial tumour syndromes typically involving the nervous system. As in the previous, 2000 edition of the WHO 'Blue Book', the classification is accompanied by a concise commentary on clinico-pathological characteristics of each tumour type. The 2007 WHO classification is based on the consensus of an international Working Group of 25 pathologists and geneticists, as well as contributions from more than 70 international experts overall, and is presented as the standard for the definition of brain tumours to the clinical oncology and cancer research communities world-wide. © Springer-Verlag 2007.",,"glial fibrillary acidic protein; synaptophysin; age; cancer classification; cancer grading; cancer research; central nervous system tumor; consensus development; disease activity; disease classification; disease predisposition; genetic analysis; glioblastoma; glioma; health care organization; histopathology; human; hypophysis tumor; international classification of diseases; medical expert; medulloblastoma; oncocytoma; pathologist; pineal body tumor; priority journal; review; rhabdoid tumor; tumor localization; world health organization; Central Nervous System Neoplasms; Humans; World Health Organization",,,,,,"Baylac, F., Martinoli, A., Marie, B., Bracard, S., Marchal, J.C., Bey, P., Sommelet, D., Plenat, F., An exceptional variety of medulloblastoma: Melanotic medulloblastoma (1997) Ann Pathol, 17, pp. 403-405; Brat, D.J., Scheithauer, B.W., Staugaitis, S.M., Holtzman, R.N., Morgello, S., Burger, P.C., Pituicytoma: A distinctive low-grade glioma of the neurohypophysis (2000) Am J Surg Pathol, 24, pp. 362-368; Burger, P.C., Pearl, D.K., Aldape, K., Yates, A.J., Scheithauer, B.W., Passe, S.M., Jenkins, R.B., James, C.D., Small cell architecture - A histological equivalent of EGFR amplification in glioblastoma multiforme?

The role of orthotopic liver transplantation in the treatment of patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma is controversial, and determining which patients are likely to have a good outcome after liver transplantation is difficult. Methods. We studied 48 patients with cirrhosis who had small, unresectable hepatocellular carcinomas and who underwent liver transplantation. In 94 percent of the patients, the cirrhosis was related to infection with hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, or both. The presence of tumor was confirmed by biopsy or serum alpha-fetoprotein assay. The criteria for eligibility for transplantation were the presence of a tumor 5 cm or less in diameter in patients with single hepatocellular carcinomas and no more than three tumor nodules, each 3 cm or less in diameter, in patients with multiple tumors. Twenty-eight patients with sufficient hepatic function underwent treatment for the tumor, mainly chemoembolization, before transplantation. After liver transplantation, the patients were followed prospectively for a median of 26 months (range, 9 to 54). No anticancer treatment was given after transplantation. Results. The overall mortality rate was 17 percent. After four years, the actuarial survival rate was 75 percent and the rate of recurrence-free survival was 83 percent. Hepatocellular carcinoma recurred in four patients (8 percent). The overall and recurrence-free survival rates at four years among the 35 patients (73 percent of the total) who met the predetermined criteria for the selection of small hepatocellular carcinomas at pathological review of the explanted liver were 85 percent and 92 percent, respectively, whereas the rates in the 13 patients (27 percent) whose tumors exceeded these limits were 50 percent and 59 percent, respectively (P=0.01 for overall survival; P=0.002 for recurrence-free survival). In this group of 48 patients with early-stage tumors, tumor-node-metastasis status, the number of tumors, the serum alpha- fetoprotein concentration, treatment received before transplantation, and 10 other variables were not significantly correlated with survival. Conclusions. Liver transplantation is an effective treatment for small, unresectable hepatocellular carcinomas in patients with cirrhosis.",,"adult; article; cancer recurrence; cancer survival; clinical article; clinical trial; disease severity; female; hepatitis b; hepatitis c; human; liver carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; liver function test; liver transplantation; male; priority journal; prognosis; prospective study; treatment outcome; Adult; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis C; Humans; Liver Cirrhosis; Liver Neoplasms; Liver Transplantation; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Survival Analysis; Treatment Outcome",,,,,,"Iwatsuki, S., Gordon, R.D., Shaw Jr., B.W., Starzl, T.E., Role of liver transplantation in cancer therapy (1985) Ann Surg, 202, pp. 401-407; O'Grady, J.G., Poison, R.J., Rolles, K., Calne, R.Y., Williams, R., Liver transplantation for malignant disease: Results in 93 consecutive patients (1988) Ann Surg, 207, pp. 373-379; Ringe, B., Wittekind, C., Bechstein, W.O., Bunzendahl, H., Pichlmayr, R., The role of liver transplantation in hepatobiliary malignancy: A retrospective analysis of 95 patients with particular regard to tumor stage and recurrence (1989) Ann Surg, 209, pp. 88-98; Ismail, T., Angrisani, L., Gunson, B.K., Primary hepatic malignancy the role of liver transplantation (1990) Br J Surg, 77, pp. 983-987; Olthoff, K.M., Milhs, J.M., Rosove, M.H., Goldstein, L.I., Ramming, K.P., Busuttil, R.W., Is liver transplantation justified for the treatment of hepatic malignancies?

Box 9503, 2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands","Mutations in codon 12,13, or 61 of one of the three ras genes, H-ros, K-ros, and N-ras, convert these genes into active oncogenes. Rapid assays for the detection of these point mutations have been developed recently and used to investigate the role mutated ras genes play in the pathogenesis of human tumors. It appeared that ras gene mutations can be found in a variety of tumor types, although the incidence varies greatly. The highest incidences are found in adenocarcinomas of the pancreas (90%), the colon (50%), and the lung (30%); in thyroid tumors (50%); and in myeloid leukemia (30%). For some tumor types a relationship may exist between the presence of a ras mutation and clinical or histopathological features of the tumor. There is some evidence that environmental agents may be involved in the induction of the mutations. © 1989, American Association for Cancer Research.

We evaluated its effects on morbidity and mortality. METHODS: Patients with New York Heart Association class IEt or IV heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction and cardiac dyssynchrony who were receiving standard pharmacologic therapy were randomly assigned to receive medical therapy alone or with cardiac Resynchronization. The primary end point was the time to death from any cause or an unplanned hospitalization for a major cardiovascular event The principal secondary end point was death from any cause. RESULTS: A total of 813 patients were enrolled and followed for a mean of 29.4 months. The primary end point was reached by 159 patients in the cardiac-Resynchronization group, as compared with 224 patients in the medical-therapy group (39 percent vs. 55 percent; hazard ratio, 0.63; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.51 to 0.77; P<0.001). There were 82 deaths in the cardiac-Resynchronization group, as compared with 120 in the medical-therapy group (20 percent vs. 30 percent; hazard ratio 0.64; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.48 to 0.85; P<0.002). As compared with medical therapy, cardiac Resynchronization reduced the interventricular mechanical delay, the end-systolic volume index, and the area of the mitral regurgitant jet; increased the left ventricular ejection fraction; and improved symptoms and the quality of life (P<0.01 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony, cardiac Resynchronization improves symptoms and the quality of life and reduces complications and the risk of death. These benefits are in addition to those afforded by standard pharmacologic therapy. The implantation of a cardiac-Resynchronization device should routinely be considered in such patients.

They regulate diverse biological processes, and bioinformatic data indicates that each miRNA can control hundreds of gene targets, underscoring the potential influence of miRNAs on almost every genetic pathway. Recent evidence has shown that miRNA mutations or mis-expression correlate with various human cancers and indicates that miRNAs can function as tumour suppressors and oncogenes. miRNAs have been shown to repress the expression of important cancer-related genes and might prove useful in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.",,"antisense oligonucleotide; complementary RNA; let 7 protein; microRNA; mir 1 protein; mir 143 protein; mir 145 protein; mir 15 protein; mir 15a protein; mir 16 1 protein; mir 16 protein; mir 181 protein; mir 196 protein; mir 221 protein; mir 222 protein; mir 273 protein; mir 375 protein; mir 430 protein; unclassified drug; bioinformatics; cancer; cancer diagnosis; cancer inhibition; correlation analysis; gene control; gene expression; gene mutation; gene repression; gene targeting; human; nonhuman; oncogene; priority journal; review; Animals; Genes, Tumor Suppressor; Humans; MicroRNAs; Neoplasms; Oncogenes",,"MicroRNAs",,,,"Bartel, D.P., MicroRNAs: Genomics, biogenesis, mechanism, and function (2004) Cell, 116, pp. 281-297; Hannon, G.J., RNA interference (2002) Nature, 418, pp. 244-251; Llave, C., Xie, Z., Kasschau, K.D., Carrington, J.C., Cleavage of Scarecrow-like mRNA targets directed by a class of Arabidopsis miRNA (2002) Science, 297, pp. 2053-2056; Palatnik, J.F., Control of leaf morphogenesis by microRNAs (2003) Nature, 425, pp. 257-263; Tang, G., Reinhart, B.J., Bartel, D.P., Zamore, P.D., A biochemical framework for RNA silencing in plants (2003) Genes Dev., 17, pp. 49-63; Yekta, S., Shih, I.H., Bartel, D.P., MicroRNA-directed cleavage of HOXB8 mRNA (2004) Science, 304, pp. 594-596; Carmell, M.A., Xuan, Z., Zhang, M.Q., Hannon, G.J., The Argonaute family: Tentacles that reach into RNAi, developmental control, stem cell maintenance, and tumorigenesis (2002) Genes Dev., 16, pp. 2733-2742; Lee, R.C., Feinbaum, R.L., Ambros, V., The C. elegans heterochronic gene lin-4 encodes small RNAs with antisense complementarity to lin-14 (1993) Cell, 75, pp. 843-854; Wightman, B., Ha, I., Ruvkun, G., Posttranscriptional regulation of the heterochronic gene lin-14 by lin-4 mediates temporal pattern formation in C. elegans (1993) Cell, 75, pp. 855-862; Olsen, P.H., Ambros, V., The lin-4 regulatory RNA controls developmental timing in Caenorhabditis elegans by blocking LIN-14 protein synthesis after the initiation of translation (1999) Dev.

METHODS: In this phase 3, open-label study, we randomly assigned previously untreated patients in East Asia who had advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma and who were nonsmokers or former light smokers to receive gefitinib (250 mg per day) (609 patients) or carboplatin (at a dose calculated to produce an area under the curve of 5 or 6 mg per milliliter per minute) plus paclitaxel (200 mg per square meter of body-surface area) (608 patients). The primary end point was progression-free survival. RESULTS: The 12-month rates of progression-free survival were 24.9% with gefitinib and 6.7% with carboplatin-paclitaxel. The study met its primary objective of showing the noninferiority of gefitinib and also showed its superiority, as compared with carboplatin - paclitaxel, with respect to progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.85; P<0.001). In the subgroup of 261 patients who were positive for the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) mutation, progression-free survival was significantly longer among those who received gefitinib than among those who received carboplatin-paclitaxel (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.64; P<0.001), whereas in the subgroup of 176 patients who were negative for the mutation, progression-free survival was significantly longer among those who received carboplatin-paclitaxel (hazard ratio for progression or death with gefitinib, 2.85; 95% CI, 2.05 to 3.98; P<0.001). The most common adverse events were rash or acne (in 66.2% of patients) and diarrhea (46.6%) in the gefitinib group and neurotoxic effects (69.9%), neutropenia (67.1%), and alopecia (58.4%) in the carboplatin-paclitaxel group. CONCLUSIONS: Gefitinib is superior to carboplatin-paclitaxel as an initial treatment for pulmonary adenocarcinoma among nonsmokers or former light smokers in East Asia. The presence in the tumor of a mutation of the EGFR gene is a strong predictor of a better outcome with gefitinib.

METHODS: Between July 2001 and April 2004, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) conducted a randomized study in which 878 patients with recurrent or advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (stage IIIB or IV) were assigned to chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (444) or paclitaxel and carboplatin plus bevacizumab (434). Chemotherapy was administered every 3 weeks for six cycles, and bevacizumab was administered every 3 weeks until disease progression was evident or toxic effects were intolerable. Patients with squamous-cell tumors, brain metastases, clinically significant hemoptysis, or inadequate organ function or performance status (ECOG performance status, >1) were excluded. The primary end point was overall survival. RESULTS: The median survival was 12.3 months in the group assigned to chemotherapy plus bevacizumab, as compared with 10.3 months in the chemotherapy-alone group (hazard ratio for death, 0.79; P = 0.003). The median progression-free survival in the two groups was 6.2 and 4.5 months, respectively (hazard ratio for disease progression, 0.66; P<0.001), with corresponding response rates of 35% and 15% (P<0.001). Rates of clinically significant bleeding were 4.4% and 0.7%, respectively (P<0.001). There were 15 treatment-related deaths in the chemotherapy-plus-bevacizumab group, including 5 from pulmonary hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of bevacizumab to paclitaxel plus carboplatin in the treatment of selected patients with non-small-cell lung cancer has a significant survival benefit with the risk of increased treatment-related deaths.

Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically blocks the EGFR. We compared the efficacy of cetuximab in combination with irinotecan with that of cetuximab alone in metastatic colorectal cancer that was refractory to treatment with irinotecan. METHODS: We randomly assigned 329 patients whose disease had progressed during or within three months after treatment with an irinotecan-based regimen to receive either cetuximab and irinotecan (at the same dose and schedule as in a prestudy regimen [218 patients]) or cetuximab monotherapy (111 patients). In cases of disease progression, the addition of irinotecan to cetuximab monotherapy was permitted. The patients were evaluated radiologically for tumor response and were also evaluated for the time to tumor progression, survival, and side effects of treatment. RESULTS: The rate of response in the combination-therapy group was significantly higher than that in the monotherapy group (22.9 percent [95 percent confidence interval, 17.5 to 29.1 percent] vs. 10.8 percent [95 percent confidence interval, 5.7 to 18.1 percent], P=0.007). The median time to progression was significantly greater in the combination-therapy group (4.1 vs. 1.5 months, P<0.001 by the log-ranktest). The median survival time was 8.6 months in the combination-therapy group and 6.9 months in the monotherapy group (P=0.48). Toxic effects were more frequent in the combination-therapy group, but their severity and incidence were similar to those that would be expected with irinotecan alone. CONCLUSIONS: Cetuximab has clinically significant activity when given alone or in combination with irinotecan in patients with irinotecan-refractory colorectal cancer.

Using a similar strategy, we have identified endostatin, an angiogenesis inhibitor produced by hemangioendothelioma. Endostatin is a 20 kDa C-terminal fragment of collagen XVIII. Endostatin specifically inhibits endothelial proliferation and potently inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth. By a novel method of sustained release, E. coli-derived endostatin was administered as a nonrefolded suspension. Primary tumors were regressed to dormant microscopic lesions. Immunohistochemistry revealed blocked angiogenesis accompanied by high proliferation balanced by apoptosis in tumor cells. There was no toxicity. Together with angiostatin data, these findings validate a strategy for identifying endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors, suggest a theme of fragments of proteins as angiogenesis inhibitors, and demonstrate dormancy therapy.",,"thrombocyte factor 4; amino acid sequence; angiogenesis; article; cancer cell culture; cancer inhibition; endothelium cell; growth inhibition; hemangioendothelioma; human cell; priority journal; protein determination; protein isolation; protein synthesis; structure activity relation; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Capillaries; Cell Division; Collagen; Collagen Type XVIII; Culture Media, Conditioned; Endostatins; Endothelium, Vascular; Hemangioendothelioma; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Inbred Strains; Molecular Sequence Data; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasms, Experimental; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Peptide Fragments; Recombinant Proteins; Tumor Cells, Cultured",,"Antineoplastic Agents; Collagen Type XVIII; Collagen, 9007-34-5; Culture Media, Conditioned; Endostatins; Peptide Fragments; Recombinant Proteins",,,,"Angiolillo, A.L., Sgadari, C., Taub, D.D., Liao, F., Farber, J.M., Miaheshwari, S., Kleinman, H.K., Tosato, G., Human interferon-inducible protein 10 is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis in vivo (1995) J.

Patients younger than 18 years, burn patients, coronary care patients, and cardiac surgery patients were excluded. —Vital status at hospital discharge. —The SAPS II includes only 17 variables: 12 physiology variables, age, type of admission (scheduled surgical, unscheduled surgical, or medical), and three underlying disease variables (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, metastatic cancer, and hematologic malignancy). Goodness-of-fit tests indicated that the model performed well in the developmental sample and validated well in an independent sample of patients (P=.883 and P=.104 in the developmental and validation samples, respectively). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.88 in the developmental sample and 0.86 in the validation sample. —The SAPS II, based on a large international sample of patients, provides an estimate of the risk of death without having to specify a primary diagnosis. This is a starting point for future evaluation of the efficiency of intensive care units. (JAMA. 1993;270:2957-2963). © 1993, American Medical Association.

Since tyrosine kinase activity is essential to the transforming function of BCR-ABL, an inhibitor of the kinase could be an effective treatment for CML. Methods: We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalating trial of STI571 (formerly known as CGP 57148B), a specific inhibitor of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. STI571 was administered orally to 83 patients with CML in the chronic phase in whom treatment with interferon alfa had failed. Patients were successively assigned to 1 of 14 doses ranging from 25 to 1000 mg per day. Results: Adverse effects of STI571 were minimal; the most common were nausea, myalgias, edema, and diarrhea. A maximal tolerated dose was not identified. Complete hematologic responses were observed in 53 of 54 patients treated with daily doses of 300 mg or more and typically occurred in the first four weeks of therapy. Of the 54 patients treated with doses of 300 mg or more, cytogenetic responses occurred in 29, including 17 (31 percent of the 54 patients who received this dose) with major responses (0 to 35 percent of cells in metaphase positive for the Philadelphia chromosome); 7 of these patients had complete cytogenetic remissions. Conclusions: STI571 is well tolerated and has significant antileukemic activity in patients with CML in whom treatment with interferon alfa had failed. Our results provide evidence of the essential role of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity in CML and demonstrate the potential for the development of anticancer drugs based on the specific molecular abnormality present in a human cancer.",,"alpha interferon;

MiRNA-expression profiling of human tumours has identified signatures associated with diagnosis, staging, progression, prognosis and response to treatment.

However, studies of health effects of long-term particulate air pollution have been less conclusive. Objective To assess the relationship between long-term exposure to fine particulate air pollution and all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants Vital status and cause of death data were collected by the American Cancer Society as part of the Cancer Prevention II study, an ongoing prospective mortality study, which enrolled approximately 1.2 million adults in 1982. Participants completed a questionnaire detailing individual risk factor data (age, sex, race, weight, height, smoking history, education, marital status, diet, alcohol consumption, and occupational exposures). The risk factor data for approximately 500 000 adults were linked with air pollution data for metropolitan areas throughout the United States and combined with vital status and cause of death data through December 31, 1998. Main Outcome Measure All-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality. Results Fine particulate and sulfur oxide-related pollution were associated with all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality. Each 10-μg/m3 elevation in fine particulate air pollution was associated with approximately a 4%, 6%, and 8% increased risk of all-cause, cardiopulmonary, and lung cancer mortality, respectively. Measures of coarse particle fraction and total suspended particles were not consistently associated with mortality. Conclusion Long-term exposure to combustion-related fine particulate air pollution is an important environmental risk factor for cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality.",,"sulfur oxide; adult; air pollution; article; cardiopulmonary insufficiency; cause of death; environmental exposure; female; human; long term exposure; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; mortality; particulate matter; priority journal; risk factor; United States; Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cause of Death; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Particle Size; Proportional Hazards Models; Pulmonary Heart Disease; Risk Factors; United States; Urban Population",,"Air Pollutants",,,,"Firket, J., The cause of the symptoms found in the Meuse Valley during the fog of December, 1930 (1931) Bull Acad R Med Belgium, 11, pp. 683-741; Ciocco, A., Thompson, D.J., A follow-up of Donora ten years after: Methodology and findings (1961) Am J Public Health, 51, pp. 155-164; Logan, W.P.D., Glasg, M.D., Mortality in London fog incident, 1952 (1953) Lancet, 1, pp. 336-338; Pope III, C.A., Dockery, D.W., Epidemiology of particle effects (1999) Air Pollution and Health, pp. 673-705. , Holgate ST, Koren H, Maynard R, Samet J, eds.

METHODS: We pooled data from 11 case-control studies from nine countries involving 1918 women with histologically confirmed squamous-cell cervical cancer and 1928 control women. A common protocol and questionnaire were used. Information on risk factors was obtained by personal interviews, and cervical cells were collected for detection of HPV DNA and typing in a central laboratory by polymerase-chain-reaction-based assays (with MY09/MY11 and GP5+/6+ primers). RESULTS: HPV DNA was detected in 1739 of the 1918 patients with cervical cancer (90.7 percent) and in 259 of the 1928 control women (13.4 percent). With the GP5+/6+ primer, HPV DNA was detected in 96.6 percent of the patients and 15.6 percent of the controls. The most common HPV types in patients, in descending order of frequency, were types 16, 18, 45, 31, 33, 52, 58, and 35. Among control women, types 16, 18, 45, 31, 6, 58, 35, and 33 were the most common. For studies using the GP5+/6+ primer, the pooled odds ratio for cervical cancer associated with the presence of any HPV was 158.2 (95 percent confidence interval, 113.4 to 220.6). The odds ratios were over 45 for the most common and least common HPV types. Fifteen HPV types were classified as high-risk types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68, 73, and 82); 3 were classified as probable high-risk types (26, 53, and 66); and 12 were classified as low-risk types (6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, 54, 61, 70, 72, 81, and CP6108). There was good agreement between our epidemiologic classification and the classification based on phylogenetic grouping. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to HPV types 16 and 18, types 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68, 73, and 82 should be considered carcinogenic, or high-risk, types, and types 26, 53, and 66 should be considered probably carcinogenic.",,"virus DNA; adult; article; cancer risk; carcinogenesis; clinical article; controlled study; disease association; disease classification; DNA fingerprinting; epidemiological data; female; high risk population; histopathology; human; human tissue; interview; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; questionnaire; squamous cell carcinoma; uterine cervix cancer; virus detection; virus strain; virus typing; Wart virus; Adenocarcinoma; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Case-Control Studies; DNA, Viral; Female; Humans; Odds Ratio; Papillomaviridae; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms",,"DNA, Viral",,,,"Ferlay, J., Bray, F., Pisani, P., Parkin, D.M., (2001) Globocan 2000: Cancer Incidence, Mortality and Prevalence Worldwide, Version 1.0, , IARC CancerBase no. 5.

These models can use a mixture of categorical and continuous variables and can handle partially observed (censored) responses. However, uncritical application of modelling techniques can result in models that poorly fit the dataset at hand, or, even more likely, inaccurately predict outcomes on new subjects. One must know how to measure qualities of a model's fit in order to avoid poorly fitted or overfitted models. Measurement of predictive accuracy can be difficult for survival time data in the presence of censoring. We discuss an easily interpretable index of predictive discrimination as well as methods for assessing calibration of predicted survival probabilities. Both types of predictive accuracy should be unbiasedly validated using bootstrapping or cross-validation, before using predictions in a new data series. We discuss some of the hazards of poorly fitted and overfitted regression models and present one modelling strategy that avoids many of the problems discussed. The methods described are applicable to all regression models, but are particularly needed for binary, ordinal, and time-to-event outcomes. Methods are illustrated with a survival analysis in prostate cancer using Cox regression.",,"accuracy; article; human; multivariate analysis; prognosis; prostate cancer; regression analysis; statistical model; survival time; Clinical Trials; Computer Graphics; Computer Simulation; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Discriminant Analysis; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Mathematical Computing; Models, Statistical; Multivariate Analysis; Prostatic Neoplasms; Regression Analysis; Software; Survival Analysis; Treatment Outcome",,,,,,"Harrell, F.E., Califf, R.M., Pryor, D.B., Lee, K.L., Rosati, R.A., Evaluating the yield of medical tests (1982) Journal of the American Medical Association, 247, pp. 2543-2546; Spiegelhalter, D.J., Probabilistic prediction in patient management (1986) Statistics in Medicine, 5, pp. 421-433; Knaus, W.A., Harrell, F.E., Fisher, C.J., Wagner, D.P., Opan, S.M., Sadoff, J.C., Draper, E.A., Grasela, T.H., The clinical evaluation of new drugs for sepsis: A prospective study design based on survival analysis (1993) Journal of the American Medical Association, 270, pp. 1233-1241; Donner, A., The relative effectiveness of procedures commonly used in multiple regression analysis for dealing with missing values (1982) American Statistician, 36, pp. 378-381; Roberts, J.S., Capalbo, G.M., A SAS macro for estimating missing values in multivariate data (1987) Proceedings of the Twelfth Annual SAS Users Group International Conference, pp. 939-941. , (Cary NC), SAS Institute; Buck, S.F., A method of estimation of missing values in multivariate data suitable for use with an electronic computer (1960) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B, 22, pp. 302-307; Timm, N.H., The estimation of variance-covariance and correlation matrices from incomplete data (1970) Psychometrika, 35, pp. 417-437; Kuhfeld, W.F., The PRINQUAL procedure (1990) SAS/STAT User's Guide, 4th Edn., 2, pp. 1265-1323. , SAS Institute, Cary NC, chapter 34; Schemper, M., Non-parametric analysis of treatment-covariate interaction in the presence of censoring (1988) Statistics in Medicine, 7, pp. 1257-1266; Cox, D.R., The regression analysis of binary sequences (with discussion) (1958) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B, 20, pp. 215-242; Walker, S.H., Duncan, D.B., Estimation of the probability of an event as a function of several independent variables (1967) Biometrika, 54, pp. 167-178; Van Houwelingen, J.C., Le Cessie, S., Logistic regression, a review (1988) Statistica Neerlandica, 42, pp. 215-232; Collett, D., (1991) Modelling Binary Data, , Chapman and Hall, London; Cox, D.R., Regression models and life-tables (with discussion) (1972) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B, 34, pp. 187-220; Collett, D., (1994) Modelling Survival Data in Medical Research, , Chapman and Hall, London; Lawless, J.F., (1982) Statistical Models and Methods for Lifetime Data, , Wiley, New York; Derksen, S., Keselman, H.J., Backward, forward and stepwise automated subset selection algorithms: Frequency of obtaining authentic and noise variables (1992) British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology, 45, pp. 265-282; Grambsch, P.M., Obrien, P.C., The effects of transformations and preliminary tests for non-linearity in regression (1991) Statistics in Medicine, 10, pp. 697-709; Verweij, P., Van Houwelingen, H.C., Penalized likelihood in Cox regression (1994) Statistics in Medicine, 13, pp. 2427-2436; Harrell, F.E., Lee, K.L., Califf, R.M., Pryor, D.B., Rosati, R.A., Regression modelling strategies for improved prognostic prediction (1984) Statistics in Medicine, 3, pp. 143-152; Marshall, G., Grover, F.L., Henderson, W.G., Hammermeister, K.E., Assessment of predictive models for binary outcomes: An empirical approach using operative death from cardiac surgery (1994) Statistics in Medicine, 13, pp. 1501-1511; Jolliffe, I.T., (1986) Principal Component Analysis, , Springer-Verlag, New York; Jackson, J.E., (1991) A User's Guide to Principal Components, , Wiley, New York; Smith, L.R., Harrell, F.E., Muhlbaier, L.H., Problems and potentials in modelling survival (1992) Medical Effectiveness Research Data Methods (Summary Report), AHCPR Pub.

To date, no treatment has had a significant impact on the disease. In early studies with gemcitabine, patients with pancreas cancer experienced an improvement in disease-related symptoms. Based on those findings, a definitive trial was performed to assess the effectiveness of gemcitabine in patients with newly diagnosed advanced pancreas cancer. Patients and Methods: One hundred twenty- six patients with advanced symptomatic pancreas cancer completed a lead-in period to characterize and stabilize pain and were randomized to receive either gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2 weekly x 7 followed by 1 week of rest, then weekly x 3 every 4 weeks thereafter (63 patients), or to fluorouracil (5-FU) 600 mg/m2 once weekly (63 patients). The primary efficacy measure was clinical benefit response, which was a composite of measurements of pain (analgesic consumption and pain intensity), Karnofsky performance status, and weight. Clinical benefit required a sustained (≤ 4 weeks) improvement in at least one parameter without worsening in any others. Other measures of efficacy included response rate, time to progressive disease, and survival. Results: Clinical benefit response was experienced by 23.8% of gemcitabine- treated patients compared with 4.8% of 5-FU-treated patients (P = .0022). The median survival durations were 5.65 and 4.41 months for gemcitabine-treated and 5-FU-treated patients, respectively (P = .0025). The survival rate at 12 months was 18% for gemcitabine patients and 2% for 5-FU patients. Treatment was well tolerated. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that gemcitabine is more effective than 5-FU in alleviation of some disease-related symptoms in patients with advanced, symptomatic pancreas cancer. Gemcitabine also confers a modest survival advantage over treatment with 5-FU.",,"analgesic agent; fluorouracil; gemcitabine; adult; advanced cancer; aged; article; blood toxicity; cancer chemotherapy; cancer survival; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; human; intravenous drug administration; major clinical study; male; pain; pancreas cancer; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; single blind procedure; treatment outcome; Adult; Aged; Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic; Deoxycytidine; Female; Fluorouracil; Humans; Infusion Pumps; Male; Middle Aged; Morphine; Narcotics; Pain; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome",,"Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic; Deoxycytidine, 951-77-9; Fluorouracil, 51-21-8; gemcitabine, 103882-84-4; Morphine, 57-27-2; Narcotics","gemzar, lilly, United States","lilly, United States",,"Warshaw, A.L., Fernández-del Castillo, C., Pancreatic carcinoma (1992) N Engl J Med, 326, pp. 455-465; Greenwald, H., Bonica, J., Burgner, M., The prevalence of pain in four cancers (1987) Cancer, 60, pp. 2563-2569; Saltzburg, D., Foley, K.M., Management of pain in pancreatic cancer (1989) Surg Clin North Am, 69, pp. 629-649; Krech, R.L., Walsh, D., Symptoms of pancreatic cancer (1991) J Pain Symptom Manage, 6, pp. 360-367; Lebovits, A., Lefkowitz, M., Pain management of pancreatic carcinoma. a review (1989) Pain, 36, pp. 1-11; Kelsen, D.P., Portenoy, R.K., Thaler, H.T., Pain and depression in patients with newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer (1995) J Clin Oncol, 13, pp. 748-755; Brennan, M.F., Kinsella, T.J., Casper, E.S., Cancer of the pancreas (1993) Cancer: Principles and Practice of Oncology (Ed 4), pp. 849-882. , De Vita VT Jr, Hellman S, Rosenberg SA (eds): Philadelphia, PA, Lippincott; Smalley, S.R., Macdonald, J.S., Pancreatic cancer (1993) Medical Oncology (Ed 2), pp. 691-712. , Calabres P, Schein PS (eds): New York, NY, McGraw-Hill; Kovach, J.S., Moertel, C.G., Schutt, A.J., A controlled study of combined 1,3-Bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea and 5-fluorouracil therapy for advanced gastric and pancreas cancer (1974) Cancer, 33, pp. 563-567; Hausen, R., Quebbman, E., Ritch, P., Continuous 5-fluorouracil infusion in carcinoma of the pancreas (1988) Am J Med Sci, 295, pp. 91-93; Crown, J., Casper, E.S., Botet, J., Lack of efficacy of high-dose leucovorin and fluorouracil in patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (1991) J Clin Oncol, 9, pp. 1682-1686; DeCaprio, J.A., Mayer, R.J., Gonin, R., Fluorouracil and high-dose leucovorin in previously untreated patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas: Results of a phase II trial (1991) J Clin Oncol, 9, pp. 2128-2133; Kelsen, D., Hudis, C., Niedzwiecki, D., A phase III comparison trial of streptozotocin, mitomycin and 5-fluorouracil with cisplatin, cytosine arabinoside, and caffeine in patients with advanced pancreatic carcinoma (1991) Cancer, 68, pp. 965-969; Cullinan, S., Moertel, C.G., Wieand, H.S., A phase III trial on the therapy of advanced pancreatic carcinoma: Evaluations of the Mallinson regimen and combined 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (1990) Cancer, 65, pp. 2207-2212; Moertel, C.G., Engstrom, P., Lavin, P.T., Chemotherapy of gastric and pancreatic carcinoma: A controlled evaluation of combinations of 5-fluorouracil with nitrosoureas and ""lactones.""

Incidence and mortality rates are age standardized to the 2000 US standard million population. A total of 1,368,030 new cancer cases and 563,700 deaths are expected in the United States in 2004. Incidence rates stabilized among men from 1995 through 2000 but continued to increase among females by 0.4% per year from 1987 through 2000. Mortality rates have decreased by 1.5% per year since 1992 among men, but have stabilized from 1998 through 2000 among women. Cancer death rates continued to decrease from the three major cancer sites in men (lung and bronchus, colon and rectum, and prostate) and from female breast and colorectal cancers in women. In analyses by race and ethnicity, African-American men and women have 40% and 20% higher death rates from all cancers combined compared with White men and women, respectively. Cancer incidence and mortality rates are lower in other racial and ethnic groups than in Whites and African Americans for all sites combined and for the four major cancer sites. However, these groups generally have higher rates for stomach, liver, and cervical cancers than do Whites. Furthermore, minority populations are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage disease than are Whites. Progress in reducing the burden from cancer can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge into practice among all segments of the population. © American Cancer Society, 2004.",,"adolescent; adult; advanced cancer; aged; article; breast cancer; cancer control; cancer diagnosis; cancer epidemiology; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer statistics; cancer survival; cause of death; child; colon cancer; ethnic difference; female; groups by age; human; infant; liver cancer; lung cancer; male; medical society; minority group; Negro; newborn; priority journal; prostate cancer; race difference; rectum cancer; sex ratio; standardization; stomach cancer; United States; uterine cervix cancer; health care organization; incidence; neoplasm; review; Cause of Death; Humans; Incidence; National Center for Health Statistics (U.S.); Neoplasms; United States",,,,,,"(2002), http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss.htm, National Center for Health Statistics, Division of Vital Statistics, Centers for Disease Control.

Methods: A total of 1207 patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned to a reference regimen of cisplatin and paclitaxel or to one of three experimental regimens: cisplatin and gemcitabine, cisplatin and docetaxel, or carboplatin and paclitaxel. Results: The response rate for all 1155 eligible patients was 19 percent, with a median survival of 7.9 months (95 percent confidence interval, 7.3 to 8.5), a 1-year survival rate of 33 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 30 to 36 percent), and a 2-year survival rate of 11 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 8 to 12 percent). The response rate and survival did not differ significantly between patients assigned to receive cisplatin and paclitaxel and those assigned to receive any of the three experimental regimens. Treatment with cisplatin and gemcitabine was associated with a significantly longer time to the progression of disease than was treatment with cisplatin and paclitaxel but was more likely to cause grade 3, 4, or 5 renal toxicity (in 9 percent of patients, vs. 3 percent of those treated with cisplatin plus paclitaxel). Patients with a performance status of 2 had a significantly lower rate of survival than did those with a performance status of 0 or 1. Conclusions: None of four chemotherapy regimens offered a significant advantage over the others in the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.

METHODS: A total of 1520 patients who had advanced heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV) due to ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathies and a QRS interval of at least 120 msec were randomly assigned in a 1:2:2 ratio to receive optimal pharmacologic therapy (diuretics, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, and spironolactone) alone or in combination with cardiac-resynchronization therapy with either a pacemaker or a pacemaker-defibrillator. The primary composite end point was the time to death from or hospitalization for any cause. RESULTS: As compared with optimal pharmacologic therapy alone, cardiac-resynchronization therapy with a pacemaker decreased the risk of the primary end point (hazard ratio, 0.81; P=0.014), as did cardiac-resynchronization therapy with a pacemaker-defibrillator (hazard ratio, 0.80; P=0.01). The risk of the combined end point of death from or hospitalization for heart failure was reduced by 34 percent in the pacemaker group (P<0.002) and by 40 percent in the pacemaker-defibrillator group (P<0.001 for the comparison with the pharmacologic-therapy group).

We here report that the induction of an EMT in immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HMLEs) results in the acquisition of mesenchymal traits and in the expression of stem-cell markers. Furthermore, we show that those cells have an increased ability to form mammospheres, a property associated with mammary epithelial stem cells. Independent of this, stem cell-like cells isolated from HMLE cultures form mammospheres and express markers similar to those of HMLEs that have undergone an EMT. Moreover, stem-like cells isolated either from mouse or human mammary glands or mammary carcinomas express EMT markers. Finally, transformed human mammary epithelial cells that have undergone an EMT form mammospheres, soft agar colonies, and tumors more efficiently. These findings illustrate a direct link between the EMT and the gain of epithelial stem cell properties. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: We enrolled 750 patients with previously untreated, metastatic renal-cell carcinoma in a multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial to receive either repeated 6-week cycles of sunitinib (at a dose of 50 mg given orally once daily for 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks without treatment) or interferon alfa (at a dose of 9 MU given subcutaneously three times weekly). The primary end point was progression-free survival. Secondary end points included the objective response rate, overall survival, patient-reported outcomes, and safety. RESULTS: The median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the sunitinib group (11 months) than in the interferon alfa group (5 months), corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.42 (95% confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.54; P<0.001). Sunitinib was also associated with a higher objective response rate than was interferon alfa (31% vs. 6%, P<0.001). The proportion of patients with grade 3 or 4 treatment-related fatigue was significantly higher in the group treated with interferon alfa, whereas diarrhea was more frequent in the sunitinib group (P<0.05). Patients in the sunitinib group reported a significantly better quality of life than did patients in the interferon alfa group (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Progression-free survival was longer and response rates were higher in patients with metastatic renal-cell cancer who received sunitinib than in those receiving interferon alfa.

Methods: In 1995, information was sought on each woman in any randomised trial that began before 1990 of adjuvant tamoxifen versus no tamoxifen before recurrence. Information was obtained and analysed centrally on each of 37,000 women in 55 such trials, comprising about 87% of the worldwide evidence. Compared with the previous such overview, this approximately doubles the amount of evidence from trials of about 5 years of tamoxifen and, taking all trials together, on events occurring more than 5 years after randomisation. Findings: Nearly 8000 of the women had a low, or zero, level of the oestrogen-receptor protein (ER) measured in their primary tumour. Among them, the overall effects of tamoxifen appeared to be small, and subsequent analyses of recurrence and total mortality are restricted to the remaining women (18,000 with ER-positive tumours, plus nearly 12,000 more with untested tumours, of which an estimated 8000 would have been ER-positive). For trials of 1 year, 2 years, and about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, the proportional recurrence reductions produced among these 30,000 women during about 10 years of follow-up were 21% (SD 3), 29% (SD 2), and 47% (SD 3), respectively, with a highly significant trend towards greater effect with longer treatment (χ1 2 = 52.0, 2p &lt; 0.00001). The corresponding proportional mortality reductions were 12% (SD 3), 17% (SD 3), and 26% (SD 4), respectively, and again the test for trend was significant (χ1 2 = 8.8) 2p = 0.003). The absolute improvement in recurrence was greater during the first 5 years, whereas the improvement in survival grew steadily larger throughout the first 10 years. The proportional mortality reductions were similar for women with node-positive and node-negative disease, but the absolute mortality reductions were greater in node-positive women. In the trials of about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen the absolute improvements in 10-year survival were 10.9% (SD 2.5) for node-positive (61.4% vs 50.5% survival, 2p &lt; 0.00001) and 5.6% (SD 1.3) for node-negative (78.9% vs 73.3% survival, 2p &lt; 0.00001). These benefits appeared to be largely irrespective of age, menopausal status, daily tamoxifen dose (which was generally 20 mg), and of whether chemotherapy had been given to both groups. In terms of other outcomes among all women studied (ie, including those with 'ER-poor' tumours), the proportional reductions in contralateral breast cancer were 13% (SD 13), 26% (SD 9), and 47% (SD 9) in the trials of 1, 2, or about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. The incidence of endometrial cancer was approximately doubled in trials of 1 or 2 years of tamoxifen and approximately quadrupled in trials of 5 years of tamoxifen (although the number of cases was small and these ratios were not significantly different from each other). The absolute decrease in contralateral breast cancer was about twice as large as the absolute increase in the incidence of endometrial cancer. Tamoxifen had no apparent effect on the incidence of colorectal cancer or, after exclusion of deaths from breast or endometrial cancer, on any of the other main categories of cause of death (total nearly 2000 such deaths; overall relative risk 0.99 [SD 0.05]). Interpretation: For women with tumours that have been reliably shown to be ER-negative, adjuvant tamoxifen remains a matter for research. However, some years of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment substantially improves the 10-year survival of women with ER-positive tumours and of women whose tumours are of unknown ER status, with the proportional reductions in breast cancer recurrence and in mortality appearing to be largely unaffected by other patient characteristics or treatments.",,"estrogen receptor;

In co-transfection assays using p53-deficient tumor cell lines, wild-type but not mutant p53 expression plasmids transactivated a reporter gene plasmid that utilized the bax gene promoter to drive transcription of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. In addition, wildtype p53 transactivated reporter gene constructs containing a heterologous minimal promoter and a 39-bp region from the bax gene promoter in which the p53-binding site consensus sequences reside. Introduction of mutations into the consensus p53-binding site sequences abolished p53 responsiveness of reporter gene plasmids. Wild-type but not mutant p53 protein bound to oligonucleotides corresponding to this region of the bax promoter, based on gel retardation assays. Taken together, the results suggest that bax is a p53 primary-response gene, presumably involved in a p53-regulated pathway for induction of apoptosis. © 1995.",,"protein p53; article; binding site; cancer cell; cell death; gene activation; gene mutation; genetic transcription; human; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; promoter region; protein dna binding; reporter gene; Base Sequence; Binding Sites; Cell Line; Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase; Comparative Study; Consensus Sequence; Cosmids; Female; Gene Expression; Gene Library; Human; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis; Oligodeoxyribonucleotides; Placenta; Plasmids; Pregnancy; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Protein p53; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; Recombinant Proteins; Restriction Mapping; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Trans-Activation (Genetics); Transfection","GENBANK: U17193","Bax protein; Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.28; Cosmids; Oligodeoxyribonucleotides; Plasmids; Protein p53; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; Recombinant Proteins",,,,"Askew, Ashmen, Simmons, Cleveland, Constitutive c-myc expression in an IL-3-dependent myeloid cell line suppresses cell cycle arrest and accelerates apoptosis (1991) Oncogene, 6, pp. 1915-1922; Ayer, Kretzner, Eisenman, Mad: a heterodimeric partner for Max that antagonizes Myc transcription activity (1993) Cell, 72, pp. 211-222; Bissonnette, Exheverri, Mahboubi, Green, Apoptotic cell death induced by c-myc is inhibited by bcl-2 (1992) Nature, 359, pp. 552-554; Blackwood, Eisenman, Max: a helix-loop-helix zipper protein that forms a sequence-specific DNA-binding complex with Myc (1991) Science, 251, pp. 1211-1215; Bristow, Jang, Peacock, Chung, Benchimol, Hill, Mutant p53 increases radioresistance in rat embryo fibroblasts simultaneously transfected with HPV16-E7 and/or activated H-ras (1994) Oncogene, 9, pp. 1527-1536; Caelles, Heimberg, Karin, p53-dependent apoptosis in the absence of transcriptional activation of p53-target genes (1994) Nature, 370, pp. 220-224; Clarke, Purdie, Harrison, Morris, Bird, Hooper, Wyllie, Thymocyte apoptosis induced by p53-dependent and independent pathways (1993) Nature, 362, pp. 849-852; El-Deiry, Kern, Pietenpol, Kinzler, Vogelstein, Definition of a consensus binding site for p53 (1992) Nature Genet., 1, pp. 45-49; El-Deiry, Tokino, Velculescu, Levy, Parsons, Trent, Lin, Vogelstein, WAF1, a potential mediator of p53 tumor suppression (1993) Cell, 75, pp. 817-825; Evan, Wyllie, Gilbert, Littlewood, Land, Brooks, Waters, Hancock, Induction of apoptosis in fibroblasts by c-myc protein (1992) Cell, 69, pp. 119-128; Fisher, Apoptosis in cancer therapy: crossing the threshold (1994) Cell, 78, pp. 539-542; Gottlieb, Haffner, von Rüden, Wagner, Oren, Down-regulation of wild-type p53 activity interferes with apoptosis of IL-3-dependent hematopoietic cells following IL-3 withdrawal (1994) EMBO J., 13, pp. 1368-1374; Harper, Adami, Wei, Keyomarsi, Elledge, The p21 CDK-interacting protein Cipl is a potent inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases (1993) Cell, 75, pp. 805-816; Ho, Hunt, Horton, Pullen, Pease, Site-directed mutagenesis by overlap extension using the polymerase chain reaction (1989) Gene, 77, pp. 51-59; Hollstein, Sidransky, Vogelstein, Harris, p53 mutations in human cancers (1991) Science, 253, pp. 49-53; Hupp, Meek, Midgley, Lane, Regulation of the specific DNA binding function of p53 (1992) Cell, 71, pp. 875-886; Kern, Pietenpol, Thiagalingam, Seymour, Kinzler, Vogelstein, Oncogenic forms of p53 inhibit p53-regulated gene expression (1992) Nature, 256, pp. 827-830; Kitada, Miyashita, Tanaka, Reed, Investigations of antisense oligonucleotides targeted against bcl-2 RNAs (1993) Antisense Res.

Tumour cell migration and metastasis share many similarities with leukocyte trafficking, which is critically regulated by chemokines and their receptors. Here we report that the chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR7 are highly expressed in human breast cancer cells, malignant breast tumours and metastases. Their respective ligands CXCL12/SDF-1α and CCL21/6Ckine exhibit peak levels of expression in organs representing the first destinations of breast cancer metastasis. In breast cancer cells, signalling through CXCR4 or CCR7 mediates actin polymerization and pseudopodia formation, and subsequently induces chemotactic and invasive responses. In vivo, neutralizing the interactions of CXCL12/CXCR4 significantly impairs metastasis of breast cancer cells to regional lymph nodes and lung. Malignant melanoma, which has a similar metastatic pattern as breast cancer but also a high incidence of skin metastases, shows high expression levels of CCR10 in addition to CXCR4 and CCR7. Our findings indicate that chemokines and their receptors have a critical role in determining the metastatic destination of tumour cells.",,"chemokine receptor; chemokine receptor CCR10; chemokine receptor ccr7; chemokine receptor CXCR4; monoclonal antibody; monoclonal antibody cxcr4; unclassified drug; actin polymerization; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; breast cancer; chemotaxis; clinical article; controlled study; disease association; human; lung metastasis; lymph node metastasis; melanoma; metastasis; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; pseudopodium; SCID mouse; tissue distribution; Actins; Animals; Blood Proteins; Breast Neoplasms; Chemokines, CXC; Chemotaxis; Humans; Lung; Lymphatic Metastasis; Mice; Mice, SCID; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Transplantation; Receptors, Chemokine; Receptors, CXCR4; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Animalia",,"Actins; Blood Proteins; CC chemokine receptor 7; Chemokines, CXC; CXCL12 chemokine; Receptors, Chemokine; Receptors, CXCR4",,,,"Nicolson, G.L., Paracrine and autocrine growth mechanisms in tumor metastasis to specific sites with particular emphasis on brain and lung metastasis (1993) Cancer Metastasis Rev., 12, pp. 325-343; Wang, J.M., Deng, X., Gong, W., Su, S., Chemokines and their role in tumor growth and metastasis (1998) J.

Distinct repertoires of receptors, SMAD proteins, and DNA-binding partners seemingly underlie, in a cell-specific manner, the multifunctional nature of TGF-β and related factors.

Epidemiologic evidence indicates that diets high in carotenoid-rich fruits and vegetables, as well as high serum levels of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) and beta carotene, are associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer. Methods. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled primary-prevention trial to determine whether daily supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta carotene, or both would reduce the incidence of lung cancer and other cancers. A total of 29,133 male smokers 50 to 69 years of age from southwestern Finland were randomly assigned to one of four regimens: alpha-tocopherol (50 mg per day) alone, beta carotene (20 mg per day) alone, both alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene, or placebo. Follow-up continued for five to eight years. Results. Among the 876 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed during the trial, no reduction in incidence was observed among the men who received alpha-tocopherol (change in incidence as compared with those who did not, -2 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -14 to 12 percent). Unexpectedly, we observed a higher incidence of lung cancer among the men who received beta carotene than among those who did not (change in incidence, 18 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 36 percent). We found no evidence of an interaction between alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene with respect to the incidence of lung cancer. Fewer cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed among those who received alpha-tocopherol than among those who did not. Beta carotene had little or no effect on the incidence of cancer other than lung cancer. Alpha- tocopherol had no apparent effect on total mortality, although more deaths from hemorrhagic stroke were observed among the men who received this supplement than among those who did not. Total mortality was 8 percent higher (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 16 percent) among the participants who received beta carotene than among those who did not, primarily because there were more deaths from lung cancer and ischemic heart disease. Conclusions. We found no reduction in the incidence of lung cancer among male smokers after five to eight years of dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol or beta carotene. In fact, this trial raises the possibility that these supplements may actually have harmful as well as beneficial effects.",,"alpha tocopherol; beta carotene; adult; aged; article; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer prevention; cancer risk; cigarette smoking; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; diet supplementation; double blind procedure; human; ischemic heart disease; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; oral drug administration; priority journal; prostate cancer; randomized controlled trial; Aged; beta Carotene; Carotenoids; Cause of Death; Double-Blind Method; Finland; Humans; Incidence; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Smoking; Vitamin E",,"beta Carotene, 7235-40-7; Carotenoids, 36-88-4; Vitamin E, 1406-18-4",,,,,"Heinonen, O.P.; National Public Health Institute, Mannerheimintie 166, Helsinki FIN-00300, Finland",,,,,,,,00284793,,NEJMA,8127329,"English","NEW ENGL.

This article reviews the links between cancer and inflammation and discusses the implications of these links for cancer prevention and treatment. We suggest that the inflammatory cells and cytokines found in tumours are more likely to contribute to tumour growth, progression, and immunosuppression than they are to mount an effective host antitumour response. Moreover cancer susceptibility and severity may be associated with functional polymorphisms of inflammatory cytokine genes, and deletion or inhibition of inflammatory cytokines inhibits development of experimental cancer. If genetic damage is the ""match that lights the fire"" of cancer, some types of inflammation may provide the ""fuel that feeds the flames"". Over the past ten years information about the cytokine and chemokine network has led to development of a range of cytokine/chemokine antagonists targeted at inflammatory and allergic diseases. The first of these to enter the clinic, tumour necrosis factor antagonists, have shown encouraging efficacy.

In preliminary screens, mutations of PTEN were detected in 31% (13/42) of glioblastoma cell lines and xenografts, 100% (4/4) of prostate cancer cell lines, 6% (4/65) of breast cancer cell lines and xenografts, and 17% (3/18) of primary glioblastomas. The predicted PTEN product has a protein tyrosine phosphatase domain and extensive homology to tensin, a protein that interacts with actin filaments at focal adhesions.

Despite its high prevalence, little is known of the prospective association of the metabolic syndrome with cardiovascular and overall mortality. Objective: To assess the association of the metabolic syndrome with cardiovascular and overall mortality using recently proposed definitions and factor analysis. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study, a population-based, prospective cohort study of 1209 Finnish men aged 42 to 60 years at baseline (1984-1989) who were initially without CVD, cancer, or diabetes. Follow-up continued through December 1998. Main Outcome Measures: Death due to coronary heart disease (CHD), CVD, and any cause among men with vs without the metabolic syndrome, using 4 definitions based on the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Results: The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome ranged from 8.8% to 14.3%, depending on the definition. There were 109 deaths during the approximately 11.4-year follow-up, of which 46 and 27 were due to CVD and CHD, respectively. Men with the metabolic syndrome as defined by the NCEP were 2.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-7.2) to 4.2 (95% CI, 1.6-10.8) times more likely and, as defined by the WHO, 2.9 (95% CI, 1.2-6.8) to 3.3 (95% CI, 1.4-7.7) times more likely to die of CHD after adjustment for conventional cardiovascular risk factors. The metabolic syndrome as defined by the WHO was associated with 2.6 (95% CI, 1.4-5.1) to 3.0 (95% CI, 1.5-5.7) times higher CVD mortality and 1.9 (95% CI, 1.2-3.0) to 2.1 (95% CI, 1.3-3.3) times higher all-cause mortality. The NCEP definition less consistently predicted CVD and all-cause mortality. Factor analysis using 13 variables associated with metabolic or cardiovascular risk yielded a metabolic syndrome factor that explained 18% of total variance. Men with loadings on the metabolic factor in the highest quarter were 3.6 (95% CI, 1.7-7.9), 3.2 (95% CI, 1.7-5.8), and 2.3 (95% CI, 1.5-3.4) times more likely to die of CHD, CVD, and any cause, respectively. Conclusions: Cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality are increased in men with the metabolic syndrome, even in the absence of baseline CVD and diabetes.

Glasgow, G., United Kingdom","Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) with appropriate surface chemistry have been widely used experimentally for numerous in vivo applications such as magnetic resonance imaging contrast enhancement, tissue repair, immunoassay, detoxification of biological fluids, hyperthermia, drug delivery and in cell separation, etc. All these biomedical and bioengineering applications require that these nanoparticles have high magnetization values and size smaller than 100 nm with overall narrow particle size distribution, so that the particles have uniform physical and chemical properties. In addition, these applications need special surface coating of the magnetic particles, which has to be not only non-toxic and biocompatible but also allow a targetable delivery with particle localization in a specific area. To this end, most work in this field has been done in improving the biocompatibility of the materials, but only a few scientific investigations and developments have been carried out in improving the quality of magnetic particles, their size distribution, their shape and surface in addition to characterizing them to get a protocol for the quality control of these particles. Nature of surface coatings and their subsequent geometric arrangement on the nanoparticles determine not only the overall size of the colloid but also play a significant role in biokinetics and biodistribution of nanoparticles in the body. The types of specific coating, or derivatization, for these nanoparticles depend on the end application and should be chosen by keeping a particular application in mind, whether it be aimed at inflammation response or anti-cancer agents. Magnetic nanoparticles can bind to drugs, proteins, enzymes, antibodies, or nucleotides and can be directed to an organ, tissue, or tumour using an external magnetic field or can be heated in alternating magnetic fields for use in hyperthermia. This review discusses the synthetic chemistry, fluid stabilization and surface modification of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, as well as their use for above biomedical applications. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In the Nottingham/Tenovus Primary Breast Cancer Study the most commonly used method, described by Bloom and Richardson, has been modified in order to make the criteria more objective. The revised technique involves semiquantitative evaluation of three morphological features - the percentage of tubule formation, the degree of nuclear pleomorphism and an accurate mitotic count using a defined field area. A numerical scoring system is used and the overall grade is derived from a summation of individual scores for the three variables; three grades of differentiation are used. Since 1973, over 2200 patients with primary operable breast cancer have been entered into a study of multiple prognostic factors. Histological grade, assessed in 1831 patients, shows a very strong correlation with prognosis; patients with grade I tumours have a significantly better survival than those with grade II and III tumours (P < 0.0001). These results demonstrate that this method for histological grading provides important prognostic information and, if the grading protocol is followed consistently, reproducible results can be obtained. Histological grade forms part of the multifactorial Nottingham prognostic index, together with tumour size and lymph node stage, which is used to stratify individual patients for appropriate therapy.","Breast; Breast cancer; Histological differentiation; Histological grade; Prognostic factors","article; breast cancer; female; follow up; histopathology; human; human tissue; major clinical study; priority journal; prognosis; Breast Neoplasms; Follow-Up Studies; Histological Techniques; Human; Mitotic Index; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Prognosis",,,,,,,"Elston, C.W.; Department of Histopathology, City Hospital, Hucknall Road, Nottingham NG5 1PB, United Kingdom",,,,,,,,03090167,,HISTD,1757079,"English","HISTOPATHOLOGY",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026072872

Since statins lower levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein as well as cholesterol, we hypothesized that people with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels but without hyperlipidemia might benefit from statin treatment. METHODS: We randomly assigned 17,802 apparently healthy men and women with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels of less than 130 mg per deciliter (3.4 mmol per liter) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels of 2.0 mg per liter or higher to rosuvastatin, 20 mg daily, or placebo and followed them for the occurrence of the combined primary end point of myocardial infarction, stroke, arterial revascularization, hospitalization for unstable angina, or death from cardiovascular causes. RESULTS: The trial was stopped after a median follow-up of 1.9 years (maximum, 5.0). Rosuvastatin reduced LDL cholesterol levels by 50% and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels by 37%. The rates of the primary end point were 0.77 and 1.36 per 100 person-years of follow-up in the rosuvastatin and placebo groups, respectively (hazard ratio for rosuvastatin, 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46 to 0.69; P<0.00001), with corresponding rates of 0.17 and 0.37 for myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.70; P = 0.0002), 0.18 and 0.34 for stroke (hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.79; P = 0.002), 0.41 and 0.77 for revascularization or unstable angina (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.70; P<0.00001), 0.45 and 0.85 for the combined end point of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.69; P<0.00001), and 1.00 and 1.25 for death from any cause (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.97; P = 0.02). Consistent effects were observed in all subgroups evaluated. The rosuvastatin group did not have a significant increase in myopathy or cancer but did have a higher incidence of physician-reported diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial of apparently healthy persons without hyperlipidemia but with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, rosuvastatin significantly reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events.

Although many patients with intermediate-grade or high-grade (aggressive) non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are cured by combination chemotherapy, the remainder are not cured and ultimately die of their disease. The Ann Arbor classification, used to determine the stage of this disease, does not consistently distinguish between patients with different long-term prognoses. This project was undertaken to develop a model for predicting outcome in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma on the basis of the patients' clinical characteristics before treatment. Methods. Adults with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma from 16 institutions and cooperative groups in the United States, Europe, and Canada who were treated between 1982 and 1987 with combination-chemotherapy regimens containing doxorubicin were evaluated for clinical features predictive of overall survival and relapse-free survival. Features that remained independently significant in step-down regression analyses of survival were incorporated into models that identified groups of patients of all ages and groups of patients no more than 60 years old with different risks of death. Results. In 2031 patients of all ages, our model, based on age, tumor stage, serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration, performance status, and number of extranodal disease sites, identified four risk groups with predicted five-year survival rates of 73 percent, 51 percent, 43 percent, and 26 percent. In 1274 patients 60 or younger, an age-adjusted model based on tumor stage, lactate dehydrogenase level, and performance status identified four risk groups with predicted five-year survival rates of 83 percent, 69 percent, 46 percent, and 32 percent. In both models, the increased risk of death was due to both a lower rate of complete responses and a higher rate of relapse from complete response. These two indexes, called the international index and the age-adjusted international index, were significantly more accurate than the Ann Arbor classification in predicting long-term survival. Conclusions. The international index and the age-adjusted international index should be used in the design of future therapeutic trials in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and in the selection of appropriate therapeutic approaches for individual patients.",,"doxorubicin; lactate dehydrogenase; adult; age; article; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer staging; cancer survival; female; human; lactate dehydrogenase blood level; major clinical study; male; nonhodgkin lymphoma; priority journal; relapse; tumor volume; Age Factors; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Human; Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin; Male; Middle Age; Prognosis; Regression Analysis; Risk; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome",,"doxorubicin, 23214-92-8, 25316-40-9; lactate dehydrogenase, 9001-60-9; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols",,,,,"Shipp, M.A.; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney St., Boston, MA 02115, United States",,,,,,,,00284793,,NEJMA,8141877,"English","New Engl.

From a large-scale miRnome analysis on 540 samples including lung, breast, stomach, prostate, colon, and pancreatic tumors, we identified a solid cancer miRNA signature composed by a large portion of overexpressed miRNAs. Among these miRNAs are some with well characterized cancer association, such as miR-17-5p, miR-20a, miR-21, miR-92, miR-106a, and miR-155. The predicted targets for the differentially expressed miRNAs are significantly enriched for protein-coding tumor suppressors and oncogenes (P < 0.0001). A number of the predicted targets, including the tumor suppressors RB1 (Retinoblastoma 1) and TGFBR2 (transforming growth factor, beta receptor II) genes were confirmed experimentally. Our results indicate that miRNAs are extensively involved in cancer pathogenesis of solid tumors and support their function as either dominant or recessive cancer genes. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Microarray; Transcriptome; Tumorigenesis","microRNA; oncoprotein; protein miR 106a; protein miR 155; protein miR 17; protein miR 20a; protein miR 21; protein miR 92; retinoblastoma protein; transforming growth factor beta receptor 2; unclassified drug; article; breast cancer; cancer genetics; cancer growth; colon cancer; computer prediction; controlled study; dominant gene; human; human tissue; lung cancer; lung parenchyma; pancreas cancer; priority journal; prostate cancer; recessive gene; solid tumor; stomach cancer; tumor suppressor gene; Gene Expression Profiling; Genes, Neoplasm; Genes, Tumor Suppressor; Humans; MicroRNAs; Neoplasms; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Tumor Cells, Cultured",,"MicroRNAs",,,,"Ambros, V., (2003) Cell, 113, pp. 673-676; Cullen, B.R., (2004) Mol.

It is intended to enable physicians without statistical training either to analyse such data themselves using life tables, the logrank test and retrospective stratification, or, when such analyses are presented, to appreciate them more critically, but the discussion may also be of interest to statisticians who have not yet specialized in clinical trial analyses. © 1977 Cancer Research Campaign.

Mutations of APC cause aberrant accumulation of β-catenin, which then binds T cell factor-4 (Tcf- 4), causing increased transcriptional activation of unknown genes. Here, the c-MYC oncogene is identified as a target gene in this signaling pathway. Expression of c-MYC was shown to be repressed by wild-type APC and activated by β-catenin, and these effects were mediated through Tcf-4 binding sites in the c-MYC promoter.

EMT also contributes to tissue repair, but it can adversely cause organ fibrosis and promote carcinoma progression through a variety of mechanisms. EMT endows cells with migratory and invasive properties, induces stem cell properties, prevents apoptosis and senescence, and contributes to immunosuppression. Thus, the mesenchymal state is associated with the capacity of cells to migrate to distant organs and maintain stemness, allowing their subsequent differentiation into multiple cell types during development and the initiation of metastasis. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

To determine the general mechanism of this tumoritropic accumulation of smancs and other proteins, we used radioactive (51Cr-labeled) proteins of various molecular sizes (M(r) 12,000 to 160,000) and other properties. In addition, we used dye-complexed serum albumin to visualize the accumulation in tumors of tumor-bearing mice. Many proteins progressively accumulated in the tumor tissues of these mice, and a ratio of the protein concentration in the tumor to that in the blood of 5 was obtained within 19 to 72 h. A large protein like immunoglobulin G required a longer time to reach this value of 5. The protein concentration ratio in the tumor to that in the blood of neither 1 nor 5 was achieved with neocarzinostatin, a representative of a small protein (M(r) 12,000) in all time. We speculate that the tumoritropic accumulation of these proteins resulted because of the hypervasculature, an enhanced permeability to even macromolecules, and little recovery through either blood vessels or lymphatic vessels. This accumulation of macromolecules in the tumor was found after i.v. injection of an albumin-dye complex (M(r) 69,000), as well as after injection into normal and tumor tissues. The complex was retained only by tumor tissue for prolonged periods. There was little lymphatic recovery of macromolecules from tumor tissue. The present finding is of potential value in macromolecular tumor therapeutics and diagnosis.",,"angiogenesis inhibitor; antineoplastic agent; protein; radioisotope; serum albumin; zinostatin; zinostatin maleic acid styrene copolymer; animal experiment; cancer chemotherapy; dose time effect relation; drug accumulation; drug clearance; drug distribution; drug mechanism; drug targeting; drug tissue level; intravenous drug administration; mouse; nonhuman; pharmacokinetics; priority journal; soft tissue; therapy; Albumins; Animal; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Antineoplastic Agents; Evans Blue; Furans; Maleic Anhydrides; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Mice; Molecular Weight; Neoplasms, Experimental; Polystyrenes; Proteins; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Zinostatin",,"protein, 67254-75-5; serum albumin, 9048-46-8; zinostatin maleic acid styrene copolymer, 123760-07-6; zinostatin, 9014-02-2; Albumins; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Antineoplastic Agents; Evans Blue, 314-13-6; Furans; Maleic Anhydrides; poly(maleic acid-styrene)neocarzinostatin; Polystyrenes; Proteins; Zinostatin, 9014-02-2",,"nippon kayaku, Japan",,,,,,,,,,,00085472,,CNREA,2946403,"English","CANCER RES.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022858683

METHODS: The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project trial B-31 compared doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel every 3 weeks (group 1) with the same regimen plus 52 weeks of trastuzumab beginning with the first dose of paclitaxel (group 2). The North Central Cancer Treatment Group trial N9831 compared three regimens: doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by weekly paclitaxel (group A), the same regimen followed by 52 weeks of trastuzumab after paclitaxel (group B), and the same regimen plus 52 weeks of trastuzumab initiated concomitantly with paclitaxel (group C). The studies were amended to include a joint analysis comparing groups 1 and A (the control group) with groups 2 and C (the trastuzumab group). Group B was excluded because trastuzumab was not given concurrently with paclitaxel. RESULTS: By March 15, 2005, 394 events (recurrent, second primary cancer, or death before recurrence) had been reported, triggering the first scheduled interim analysis. Of these, 133 were in the trastuzumab group and 261 in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.48; P<0.0001). This result crossed the early stopping boundary. The absolute difference in disease-free survival between the trastuzumab group and the control group was 12 percent at three years. Trastuzumab therapy was associated with a 33 percent reduction in the risk of death (P=0.015). The three-year cumulative incidence of class III or IV congestive heart failure or death from cardiac causes in the trastuzumab group was 4.1 percent in trial B-31 and 2.9 percent in trial N9831. CONCLUSIONS: Trastuzumab combined with paclitaxel after doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide improves outcomes among women with surgically removed HER2-positive breast cancer.

Aerobic glycolysis is an inefficient way to generate adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), however, and the advantage it confers to cancer cells has been unclear. Here we propose that the metabolism of cancer cells, and indeed all proliferating cells, is adapted to facilitate the uptake and incorporation of nutrients into the biomass (e.g., nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids) needed to produce a new cell. Supporting this idea are recent studies showing that (i) several signaling pathways implicated in cell proliferation also regulate metabolic pathways that incorporate nutrients into biomass; and that (ii) certain cancer-associated mutations enable cancer cells to acquire and metabolize nutrients in a manner conducive to proliferation rather than efficient ATP production. A better understanding of the mechanistic links between cellular metabolism and growth control may ultimately lead to better treatments for human cancer.",,"adenosine triphosphate; amino acid; lipid; nucleotide; cytology; metabolism; biomass; cancer cell; cell growth; cell metabolism; cell proliferation; cell transport; glycolysis; growth regulation; human; mammal cell; metabolic regulation; mutation; nutrient uptake; oxidative phosphorylation; priority journal; review; signal transduction; Adenosine Triphosphate; Aerobiosis; Amino Acids; Animals; Cell Proliferation; Glucose; Glycolysis; Humans; Lipids; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Mutation; Neoplasms; Nucleotides; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Signal Transduction",,"adenosine triphosphate, 15237-44-2, 56-65-5, 987-65-5; amino acid, 65072-01-7; lipid, 66455-18-3; Adenosine Triphosphate, 56-65-5; Amino Acids; Glucose, 50-99-7; Lipids; Nucleotides",,,,"Hsu, P.P., Sabatini, D.M., (2008) Cell, 134, p. 703; Deberardinis, R.J., Lum, J.J., Hatzivassiliou, G., Thompson, C.B., (2008) Cell Metab, 7, p. 11; Warburg, O., Posener, K., Negelein, E., (1924) Biochem.

Exposure of MI -1 myeloblastic leukemia cells to nonlethal doses of the DNA damaging agents, -Â»-irradiationor actinomycin D, causes a transient inhibition of replicative DNA synthesis via both (., and (F. arrests. Levels of p53 protein in MI -I cells and in proliferating normal bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells increase and decrease in temporal association with the Gãarrest. In contrast, the S-phase arrest of MI -1 cells caused by exposure to the anti-metabolite, cytosino arabinoside, which does not directly damage DNA, is not associated with a significant change in p53 protein levels. Caffeine treatment blocks both the (F, arrest and the induction of p53 protein after f-irradiation, thus suggesting that blocking the induction of pS3 protein may contribute to the previously observed effects of caffeine on cell cycle changes after DNA damage. Unlike MI -I cells and normal bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells, hematopoietic cells that either lack p53 gene expression or overexpress a mutant form of the pS3 gene do not exhibit a (., arrest after -y-irradiation; however, the G2 arrest is unaffected by the status of the p53 gene. These results suggest a role for the wild-type pS3 protein in the inhibition of DNA synthesis that follows DNA damage and thus suggest a new mechanism for how the loss of wild-type p53 might contribute to tumorigenesis. © 1991, American Association for Cancer Research.

Since the publication of the American Thyroid Association's guidelines for the management of these disorders was published in 2006, a large amount of new information has become available, prompting a revision of the guidelines. Methods: Relevant articles through December 2008 were reviewed by the task force and categorized by topic and level of evidence according to a modified schema used by the United States Preventative Services Task Force. Results: The revised guidelines for the management of thyroid nodules include recommendations regarding initial evaluation, clinical and ultrasound criteria for fine-needle aspiration biopsy, interpretation of fine-needle aspiration biopsy results, and management of benign thyroid nodules. Recommendations regarding the initial management of thyroid cancer include those relating to optimal surgical management, radioiodine remnant ablation, and suppression therapy using levothyroxine. Recommendations related to long-term management of differentiated thyroid cancer include those related to surveillance for recurrent disease using ultrasound and serum thyroglobulin as well as those related to management of recurrent and metastatic disease. Conclusions: We created evidence-based recommendations in response to our appointment as an independent task force by the American Thyroid Association to assist in the clinical management of patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer. They represent, in our opinion, contemporary optimal care for patients with these disorders. © Copyright 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"axitinib; bortezomib; doxorubicin; geldanomycin; glucocorticoid; levothyroxine; motesanib; pazopanib; radioactive iodine; sorafenib; thalidomide; thyroglobulin; unclassified drug; aspiration biopsy; bone metastasis; brain metastasis; cancer diagnosis; cancer epidemiology; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; cervical lymph node; clinical assessment; clinical feature; clinical trial; diagnostic imaging; echography; evidence based practice; gene therapy; human; long term care; lung metastasis; lymph node dissection; medical society; metastasis; practice guideline; priority journal; recurrent disease; review; risk assessment; thyroglobulin blood level; thyroid cancer; thyroid carcinoma; thyroid nodule; thyroidectomy; tumor suppressor gene; tumor volume; United States; Adenocarcinoma; Biopsy, Fine-Needle; Carcinoma, Papillary; Combined Modality Therapy; Diagnosis, Differential; Disease Progression; Humans; Iodine Radioisotopes; Lymph Nodes; Neck; Physical Examination; Prognosis; Thyroid Gland; Thyroid Neoplasms; Treatment Outcome; United States",,"axitinib, 319460-85-0; bortezomib, 179324-69-7, 197730-97-5; doxorubicin, 23214-92-8, 25316-40-9; levothyroxine, 51-48-9; motesanib, 453562-69-1, 857876-30-3; pazopanib, 444731-52-6, 635702-64-6; sorafenib, 284461-73-0; thalidomide, 50-35-1; thyroglobulin, 9010-34-8; Iodine Radioisotopes",,,,"Tunbridge, W.M.G., Evered, D.C., Hall, R., Appleton, D., Brewis, M., Clark, F., Evans, J.G., Smith, P.A., The spectrum of thyroid disease in a community: The Whickham Survey (1977) Clin Endocrinol, 7, pp. 481-493. , (Oxf ); Vander, J.B., Gaston, E.A., Dawber, T.R., The significance of nontoxic thyroid nodules (1968) Ann Intern Med, 69, pp. 537-540; Tan, G.H., Gharib, H., Thyroid incidentalomas: Management approaches to nonpalpable nodules discovered incidentally on thyroid imaging (1997) Ann Intern Med, 126, pp. 226-231; Hegedus, L., Clinical practice. the thyroid nodule (2004) N Engl J Med, 351, pp. 1764-1771; Mandel SJ 2004A 64-year-old woman with a thyroid nodule JAMA, 292, pp. 2632-2642; Sherman, S.I., Thyroid carcinoma (2003) Lancet, 361, pp. 501-511; Jemal, A., Siegel, R., Ward, E., Hao, Y., Xu, J., Thun, M.J., Cancer statistics, 2009 (2009) CA Cancer J Clin., 27, p. 2009. , Published online before print May; Davies, L., Welch, H.G., Increasing incidence of thyroid cancer in the United States, 1973-2002 (2006) JAMA, 295, pp. 2164-2167; Leenhardt, L., Bernier, M.O., Boin-Pineau, M.H., Conte, D.B., Marechaud, R., Niccoli-Sire, P., Nocaudie, M., De Vathaire, F., Advances in diagnostic practices affect thyroid cancer incidence in France (2004) Eur J Endocrinol, 150, pp. 133-139; Singer, P.A., Cooper, D.S., Daniels, G.H., Ladenson, P.W., Greenspan, F.S., Levy, E.G., Braverman, L.E., Dorfman, S.G., Treatment guidelines for patients with thyroid nodules and well-differentiated thyroid cancer.

This therapy results in a sequence of photochemical and photobiologic processes that cause irreversible photodamage to tumor tissues. Results from preclinical and clinical studies conducted worldwide over a 25- year period have established photodynamic therapy as a useful treatment approach for some cancers. Since 1993, regulatory approval for photodynamic therapy involving use of a partially purified, commercially available hematoporphyrin derivative compound (Photofrin®) in patients with early and advanced stage cancer of the lung, digestive tract, and genitourinary tract has been obtained in Canada, The Netherlands, France, Germany, Japan, and the United States. We have attempted to conduct and present a comprehensive review of this rapidly expanding field. Mechanisms of subcellular and tumor localization of photosensitizing agents, as well as of molecular, cellular, and tumor responses associated with photodynamic therapy, are discussed.

We have generated high-resolution maps for the genome-wide distribution of 20 histone lysine and arginine methylations as well as histone variant H2A.Z, RNA polymerase II, and the insulator binding protein CTCF across the human genome using the Solexa 1G sequencing technology. Typical patterns of histone methylations exhibited at promoters, insulators, enhancers, and transcribed regions are identified. The monomethylations of H3K27, H3K9, H4K20, H3K79, and H2BK5 are all linked to gene activation, whereas trimethylations of H3K27, H3K9, and H3K79 are linked to repression. H2A.Z associates with functional regulatory elements, and CTCF marks boundaries of histone methylation domains. Chromosome banding patterns are correlated with unique patterns of histone modifications. Chromosome breakpoints detected in T cell cancers frequently reside in chromatin regions associated with H3K4 methylations. Our data provide new insights into the function of histone methylation and chromatin organization in genome function. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Because these new micro-array devices generate bewildering amounts of raw data, new analytical methods must be developed to sort out whether cancer tissues have distinctive signatures of gene expression over normal tissues or other types of cancer tissues. In this paper, we address the problem of selection of a small subset of genes from broad patterns of gene expression data, recorded on DNA micro-arrays. Using available training examples from cancer and normal patients, we build a classifier suitable for genetic diagnosis, as well as drug discovery. Previous attempts to address this problem select genes with correlation techniques. We propose a new method of gene selection utilizing Support Vector Machine methods based on Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). We demonstrate experimentally that the genes selected by our techniques yield better classification performance and are biologically relevant to cancer. In contrast with the baseline method, our method eliminates gene redundancy automatically and yields better and more compact gene subsets. In patients with leukemia our method discovered 2 genes that yield zero leave-one-out error, while 64 genes are necessary for the baseline method to get the best result (one leave-one-out error). In the colon cancer database, using only 4 genes our method is 98% accurate, while the baseline method is only 86% accurate.","Cancer classification; Diagnosis; Diagnostic tests; DNA micro-array; Drug discovery; Feature selection; Gene selection; Genomics; Proteomics; Recursive feature elimination; RNA expression; Support vector machines","Correlation methods; Data recording; Database systems; Diagnosis; DNA; Drug products; Feature extraction; Genetic engineering; Oncology; RNA; Tissue; Cancer classification; DNA microarrays; Drug discovery; Feature selection; Gene selection; Genomics; Proteomics; Recursive feature elimination; RNA expression; Support vector machines; Learning systems",,,,,,"Aerts, H., Chitotriosidase - New biochemical marker (1996) Gauchers News; Alizadeh, A., Distinct types of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma identified by gene expression profiling (2000) Nature, 403 (3), pp. 503-511; Alon, U., Broad patterns of gene expression revealed by clustering analysis of tumor and normal colon cancer tissues probed by oligonucleotide arrays (1999) PNAS, 96, pp. 6745-6750. , http://www.molbio.princeton.edu/colondata, Cell Biology; Aronson, N., Remodeling the mammary GI and at the termination of breast feeding: Role of a new regulator protein BRP39 (1999) The Beat, , University of South Alabama College of Medecine, July, 1999; Ben Hur, A., Horn, D., Siegelman, H., Vapnik, V., A support vector method for clustering (2000) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 13. , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Blum, A., Langley, P., Selection of relevant features and examples in machine learning (1997) Artificial Intelligence, 97, pp. 245-271; Boser, B., Guyon, I., Vapnik, V., An training algorithm for optimal margin classifiers (1992) Proceedings of the Fifth Annual Workshop on Computational Learning Theory, pp. 144-152. , Pittsburgh: ACM; Bradley, P., Mangasarian, O., Feature selection via concave minimization and support vector machines (1998) Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 82-90. , San Francisco, CA; Bradley, P., Mangasarian, O., Street, W., Feature selection via mathematical programming (1998) INFORMS Journal on Computing, 10, pp. 209-217. , Technical Report; Bredensteiner, E., Bennett, K., Multicategory classification for support vector machines (1999) Computational Optimizations and Applications, 12, pp. 53-79; Brown, M.P.S., Grundy, W.N., Lin, D., Cristianini, N., Sugnet, C.W., Furey, T.S., Ares Jr., M., Haussler, D., Knowledge-based analysis of microarray gene expression data by using support vector machines (2000) PNAS, 97 (1), pp. 262-267; Chapelle, O., Vapnik, V., Bousquet, O., Mukherjee, S., Choosing kernel parameters for support vector machines (2000), AT&T Labs Technical ReportCortes, C., Vapnik, V., Support vector networks (1995) Machine Learning, 20 (3), pp. 273-297; Cristianini, N., Shawe-Taylor, J., (1999) An Introduction to Support Vector Machines, , Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press; Duda, R.O., Hart, P.E., Pattern classification and scene analysis (1973), New York: WileyEisen, M.B., Spellman, P.T., Brown, P.O., Botstein, D., Cluster analysis and display of genome-wide expression patterns (1998) PNAS, 95, pp. 14863-14868; Fodor, S.A., Massively parallel genomics (1997) Science, 277, pp. 393-395; Furey, T., Cristianini, N., Duffy, N., Bednarski, D., Schummer, M., Haussler, D., Support vector machine classification and validation of cancer tissue samples using microarray expression data (2000) Bioinformatics, 16, pp. 906-914; Ghigna, C., Moroni, M., Porta, C., Riva, I., Biamonti, G., Altered expression of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins and SR factors in human (1998) Cancer Research, 58, pp. 5818-5824; Golub, T.R., Slonim, D.K., Tamayo, P., Huard, C., Gaasenbeek, M., Mesirov, J.P., Coller, H., Lander, E.S., Molecular classification of cancer: Class discovery and class prediction by gene expression monitoring (1999) Science, 286, pp. 531-537. , http://www.genome.wi.mit.edu/MPR/data_set_ALL_AML.html; Guyon, I., (1999), http://www.clopinet.com/SVM.applications.html, SVM Application SurveyGuyon, I., Makhoul, J., Schwartz, R., Vapnik, V., What size test set gives good error rate estimates?

METHODS: From November 2003 to March 2005, we randomly assigned 903 patients with renal-cell carcinoma that was resistant to standard therapy to receive either continuous treatment with oral sorafenib (at a dose of 400 mg twice daily) or placebo; 451 patients received sorafenib and 452 received placebo. The primary end point was overall survival. A single planned analysis of progression-free survival in January 2005 showed a statistically significant benefit of sorafenib over placebo. Consequently, crossover was permitted from placebo to sorafenib, beginning in May 2005. RESULTS: At the January 2005 cutoff, the median progression-free survival was 5.5 months in the sorafenib group and 2.8 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio for disease progression in the sorafenib group, 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35 to 0.55; P<0.01). The first interim analysis of overall survival in May 2005 showed that sorafenib reduced the risk of death, as compared with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.94; P = 0.02), although this benefit was not statistically significant according to the O'Brien-Fleming threshold. Partial responses were reported as the best response in 10% of patients receiving sorafenib and in 2% of those receiving placebo (P<0.001). Diarrhea, rash, fatigue, and hand-foot skin reactions were the most common adverse events associated with sorafenib. Hypertension and cardiac ischemia were rare serious adverse events that were more common in patients receiving sorafenib than in those receiving placebo. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with placebo, treatment with sorafenib prolongs progression-free survival in patients with advanced clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma in whom previous therapy has failed; however, treatment is associated with increased toxic effects.

In some types of cancer, inflammatory conditions are present before a malignant change occurs. Conversely, in other types of cancer, an oncogenic change induces an inflammatory microenvironment that promotes the development of tumours. Regardless of its origin, 'smouldering' inflammation in the tumour microenvironment has many tumour-promoting effects. It aids in the proliferation and survival of malignant cells, promotes angiogenesis and metastasis, subverts adaptive immune responses, and alters responses to hormones and chemotherapeutic agents. The molecular pathways of this cancer-related inflammation are now being unravelled, resulting in the identification of new target molecules that could lead to improved diagnosis and treatment. © 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Incidence and death rates are age adjusted to the 2000 US standard population. In the year 2003, we estimate that 1,334,100 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed, and 556,500 people will die from cancer in the United States. Age-adjusted cancer death rates declined in both males and females in the 1990s, though the magnitude of decline is substantially higher in males than in females. In contrast, incidence rates continued to increase in females while stabilizing in males. African-American males showed the largest decline for mortality. However, African Americans still carry the highest burden of cancer with diagnosis of cancer at a later stage and poorer survival within each stage compared with Whites. In spite of the continued decline in cancer death rates in the most recent time period, the total number of recorded cancer deaths in the United States continues to increase slightly due to the aging and expanding population.",,"adolescent; adult; age; aged; aging; article; cancer center; cancer diagnosis; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer staging; cancer statistics; cancer survival; Caucasian; child; controlled study; ethnic difference; female; health statistics; health survey; human; major clinical study; male; medical society; morbidity; negro; population growth; population research; priority journal; sex difference; standard; statistical analysis; time; United States; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; American Cancer Society; Cause of Death; Child; Child, Preschool; Epidemiologic Factors; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Neoplasms; Socioeconomic Factors; United States",,,,,,"(2002), http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss.htm, National Center for Health Statistics, Division of Vital Statistics, Centers for Disease Control.

METHODS: We conducted a phase 3 randomized clinical trial comparing vemurafenib with dacarbazine in 675 patients with previously untreated, metastatic melanoma with the BRAF V600E mutation. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either vemurafenib (960 mg orally twice daily) or dacarbazine (1000 mg per square meter of body-surface area intravenously every 3 weeks). Coprimary end points were rates of overall and progression-free survival. Secondary end points included the response rate, response duration, and safety. A final analysis was planned after 196 deaths and an interim analysis after 98 deaths. RESULTS: At 6 months, overall survival was 84% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78 to 89) in the vemurafenib group and 64% (95% CI, 56 to 73) in the dacarbazine group. In the interim analysis for overall survival and final analysis for progression-free survival, vemurafenib was associated with a relative reduction of 63% in the risk of death and of 74% in the risk of either death or disease progression, as compared with dacarbazine (P<0.001 for both comparisons). After review of the interim analysis by an independent data and safety monitoring board, crossover from dacarbazine to vemurafenib was recommended. Response rates were 48% for vemurafenib and 5% for dacarbazine. Common adverse events associated with vemurafenib were arthralgia, rash, fatigue, alopecia, keratoacanthoma or squamous-cell carcinoma, photosensitivity, nausea, and diarrhea; 38% of patients required dose modification because of toxic effects. CONCLUSIONS: Vemurafenib produced improved rates of overall and progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated melanoma with the BRAF V600E mutation.

Results from this assay were compared with data assimilated simultaneously by clonogenic assay and by dye exclusion assay. Good correlation was observed using the CHO-AuxBl cell line and the pleiotropic drug-resistant mutant CHRC5, with similar degrees of relative resistance observed with both the MTT and clonogenic assays. Good correlation was observed between the clonogenic and MTT assays for 1-h drug exposures, although the MTT assay was more sensitive to vinblastine. In general, the clonogenic assay was more sensitive when continuous drug exposures were utilized, although this was primarily related to the increased drug exposure time. While the use of the MTT assay in drug sensitivity testing of primary tumor samples is limited, since contaminating normal cells may also reduce the tetrazolium, the MTT assay can be semiautomated, and therefore it offers a valid, simple method of assessing chemosensitivity in established cell lines. © 1987, American Association for Cancer Research.

Objective: To assess the effects on major disease incidence rates of the most commonly used postmenopausal hormone therapy in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled disease prevention trial (the estrogen-alone component of the Women's Health Initiative [WHI]) conducted in 40 US clinical centers beginning in 1993. Enrolled were 10739 postmenopausal women, aged 50-79 years, with prior hysterectomy, including 23% of minority race/ethnicity. Intervention: Women were randomly assigned to receive either 0.625 mg/d of conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) or placebo. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence (nonfatal myocardial infarction or CHD death). Invasive breast cancer incidence was the primary safety outcome. A global index of risks and benefits, including these primary outcomes plus stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, and deaths from other causes, was used for summarizing overall effects. Results: In February 2004, after reviewing data through November 30, 2003, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) decided to end the intervention phase of the trial early. Estimated hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for CEE vs placebo for the major clinical outcomes available through February 29, 2004 (average follow-up 6.8 years), were: CHD, 0.91 (0.75-1.12) with 376 cases; breast cancer, 0.77 (0.59-1.01) with 218 cases; stroke, 1.39 (1.10-1.77) with 276 cases; PE, 1.34 (0.87-2.06) with 85 cases; colorectal cancer, 1.08 (0.75-1.55) with 119 cases; and hip fracture, 0.61 (0.41-0.91) with 102 cases. Corresponding results for composite outcomes were: total cardiovascular disease, 1.12 (1.01-1.24); total cancer, 0.93 (0.81-1.07); total fractures, 0.70 (0.63-0.79); total mortality, 1.04 (0.88-1.22), and the global index, 1.01 (0.91-1.12). For the outcomes significantly affected by CEE, there was an absolute excess risk of 12 additional strokes per 10000 person-years and an absolute risk reduction of 6 fewer hip fractures per 10000 person-years. The estimated excess risk for all monitored events in the global index was a nonsignificant 2 events per 10000 person-years. Conclusions: The use of CEE increases the risk of stroke, decreases the risk of hip fracture, and does not affect CHD incidence in postmenopausal women with prior hysterectomy over an average of 6.8 years. A possible reduction in breast cancer risk requires further investigation. The burden of incident disease events was equivalent in the CEE and placebo groups, indicating no overall benefit. Thus, CEE should not be recommended for chronic disease prevention in postmenopausal women.",,"estrogen; placebo; conjugated estrogen; estrogen; adult; aged; article; breast cancer; breast tenderness;

Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States","BACKGROUND: Mitoxantrone plus prednisone reduces pain and improves the quality of life in men with advanced, hormone-refractory prostate cancer, but it does not improve survival. We compared such treatment with docetaxel plus prednisone in men with this disease. METHODS: From March 2000 through June 2002, 1006 men with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer received 5 mg of prednisone twice daily and were randomly assigned to receive 12 mg of mitoxantrone per square meter of body-surface area every three weeks, 75 mg of docetaxel per square meter every three weeks, or 30 mg of docetaxel per square meter weekly for five of every six weeks. The primary end point was overall survival. Secondary end points were pain, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, and the quality of life. All statistical comparisons were against mitoxantrone. RESULTS: As compared with the men in the mitoxantrone group, men in the group given docetaxel every three weeks had a hazard ratio for death of 0.76 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to 0.94; P=0.009 by the stratified log-rank test) and those given weekly docetaxel had a hazard ratio for death of 0.91 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.75 to 1.11; P=0.36). The median survival was 16.5 months in the mitoxantrone group, 18.9 months in the group given docetaxel every 3 weeks, and 17.4 months in the group given weekly docetaxel. Among these three groups, 32 percent, 45 percent, and 48 percent of men, respectively, had at least a 50 percent decrease in the serum PSA level (P<0.001 for both comparisons with mitoxantrone); 22 percent, 35 percent (P= 0.01), and 31 percent (P=0.08) had predefined reductions in pain; and 13 percent, 22 percent (P=0.009), and 23 percent (P=0.005) had improvements in the quality of life. Adverse events were also more common in the groups that received docetaxel. CONCLUSIONS: When given with prednisone, treatment with docetaxel every three weeks led to superior survival and improved rates of response in terms of pain, serum PSA level, and quality of life, as compared with mitoxantrone plus prednisone.

Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the CD20 B-cell antigen, has therapeutic activity in diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma. We conducted a randomized trial to compare CHOP chemotherapy plus rituximab with CHOP alone in elderly patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma. Methods: Previously untreated patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma, 60 to 80 years old, were randomly assigned to receive either eight cycles of CHOP every three weeks (197 patients) or eight cycles of CHOP plus rituximab given on day 1 of each cycle (202 patients). Results: The rate of complete response was significantly higher in the group that received CHOP plus rituximab than in the group that received CHOP alone (76 percent vs. 63 percent, P=0.005). With a median follow-up of two years, event-free and overall survival times were significantly higher in the CHOP-plus-rituximab group (P<0.001 and P=0.007, respectively). The addition of rituximab to standard CHOP chemotherapy significantly reduced the risk of treatment failure and death (risk ratios, 0.58 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.44 to 0.77] and 0.64 [0.45 to 0.89], respectively). Clinically relevant toxicity was not significantly greater with CHOP plus rituximab. Conclusions: The addition of rituximab to the CHOP regimen increases the complete-response rate and prolongs event-free and overall survival in elderly patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma, without a clinically significant increase in toxicity.

However, routine lymphadenectomy for patients with clinical stage I melanoma remains controversial because most of these patients do not have nodal metastases, are unlikely to benefit from the operation, and may suffer troublesome postoperative edema of the limbs. A new procedure was developed using vital dyes that permits intraoperative identification of the sentinel lymph node, the lymph node nearest the site of the primary melanoma, on the direct drainage pathway. The most likely site of early metastases, the sentinel node can be removed for immediate intraoperative study to identify clinically occult melanoma cells. We successfully identified the sentinel node(s) in 194 of 237 lymphatic basins and detected metastases in 40 specimens (21%) on examination of routine hematoxylin-eosin—stained slides (12%) or exclusively in immunohistochemically stained preparations (9%). Metastases were present in 47 (18%) of 259 sentinel nodes, while nonsentinel nodes were the sole site of metastasis in only two of 3079 nodes from 194 lymphadenectomy specimens that had an identifiable sentinel node, a false-negative rate of less than 1%. Thus, this technique identifies, with a high degree of accuracy, patients with early stage melanoma who have nodal metastases and are likely to benefit from radical lymphadenectomy. © 1992, American Medical Association.

The structural design involves encapsulating luminescent QDs with an ABC triblock copolymer and linking this amphiphilic polymer to tumor-targeting ligands and drug-delivery functionalities. In vivo targeting studies of human prostate cancer growing in nude mice indicate that the QD probes accumulate at tumors both by the enhanced permeability and retention of tumor sites and by antibody binding to cancer-specific cell surface biomarkers. Using both subcutaneous injection of QD-tagged cancer cells and systemic injection of multifunctional QD probes, we have achieved sensitive and multicolor fluorescence imaging of cancer cells under in vivo conditions. We have also integrated a whole-body macro-illumination system with wavelength-resolved spectral imaging for efficient background removal and precise delineation of weak spectral signatures.

Design - Meta-analysis using updated data on individual patients from all available randomised trials, both published and unpublished. Subjects - 9387 patients (7151 deaths) from 52 randomised clinical trials. Main outcome measure - Survival. Results - The results for modern regimens containing cisplatin favoured chemotherapy in all comparisons and reached conventional levels of significance when used with radical radiotherapy and with supportive care. Trials comparing surgery with surgery plus chemotherapy gave a hazard ratio of 0.87 (13% reduction in the risk of death, equivalent to an absolute benefit of 5% at five years). Trials comparing radical radiotherapy with radical radiotherapy plus chemotherapy gave a hazard ratio of 0.87 (13% reduction in the risk of death; absolute benefit of 4% at two years), and trials comparing supportive care with supportive care plus chemotherapy 0.73 (27% reduction in the risk of death; 10% improvement in survival at one year). The essential drugs needed to achieve these effects were not identified. No difference in the size of effect was seen in any subgroup of patients. In all but the radical radiotherapy setting, older trials using long term alkylating agents tended to show a detrimental effect of chemotherapy. This effect reached conventional significance in the adjuvant surgical comparison. Conclusion - At the outset of this meta-analysis there was considerable pessimism about the role of chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer. These results offer hope of progress and suggest that chemotherapy may have a role in treating this disease.",,"alkylating agent; busulfan; chlormethine; cisplatin; cyclophosphamide; cytotoxic agent; doxorubicin; epirubicin; etoposide; fluorouracil; lomustine; methotrexate; mitomycin c; nitrosourea; prednisolone; procarbazine; tegafur; uft; vinblastine; vinca alkaloid; vincristine; vindesine; article; clinical trial; comparative study; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; data analysis; human; lung non small cell cancer; major clinical study; meta analysis; patient care; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; risk; survival; treatment outcome; Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cisplatin; Combined Modality Therapy; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Proportional Hazards Models; Randomized Controlled Trials; Survival Analysis; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome",,"Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating; Cisplatin, 15663-27-1",,,,,"Stewart, L.A.; MRC Cancer Trials Office, 5 Shaftesbury Road, Cambridge CB2 2BW, United Kingdom",,,,,,,,09598146,,BMJOA,7580546,"English","BR.

These projections, which are based on 1990 data, continue to be widely quoted, although they are substantially outdated; in particular, they substantially underestimated the spread of HIV/AIDS. To address the widespread demand for information on likely future trends in global health, and thereby to support international health policy and priority setting, we have prepared new projections of mortality and burden of disease to 2030 starting from World Health Organization estimates of mortality and burden of disease for 2002. This paper describes the methods, assumptions, input data, and results. Methods and Findings: Relatively simple models were used to project future health trends under three scenarios - baseline, optimistic, and pessimistic - based largely on projections of economic and social development, and using the historically observed relationships of these with cause-specific mortality rates. Data inputs have been updated to take account of the greater availability of death registration data and the latest available projections for HIV/AIDS, income, human capital, tobacco smoking, body mass index, and other inputs. In all three scenarios there is a dramatic shift in the distribution of deaths from younger to older ages and from communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional causes to noncommunicable disease causes. The risk of death for children younger than 5 y is projected to fall by nearly 50% in the baseline scenario between 2002 and 2030. The proportion of deaths due to noncommunicable disease is projected to rise from 59% in 2002 to 69% in 2030. Global HIV/AIDS deaths are projected to rise from 2.8 million in 2002 to 6.5 million in 2030 under the baseline scenario, which assumes coverage with antiretroviral drugs reaches 80% by 2012. Under the optimistic scenario, which also assumes increased prevention activity, HIV/AIDS deaths are projected to drop to 3.7 million in 2030. Total tobacco-attributable deaths are projected to rise from 5.4 million in 2005 to 6.4 million in 2015 and 8.3 million in 2030 under our baseline scenario. Tobacco is projected to kill 50% more people in 2015 than HIV/AIDS, and to be responsible for 10% of all deaths globally. The three leading causes of burden of disease in 2030 are projected to include HIV/AIDS, unipolar depressive disorders, and ischaemic heart disease in the baseline and pessimistic scenarios. Road traffic accidents are the fourth leading cause in the baseline scenario, and the third leading cause ahead of ischaemic heart disease in the optimistic scenario. Under the baseline scenario, HIV/AIDS becomes the leading cause of burden of disease in middle- and low-income countries by 2015. Conclusions: These projections represent a set of three visions of the future for population health, based on certain explicit assumptions. Despite the wide uncertainty ranges around future projections, they enable us to appreciate better the implications for health and health policy of currently observed trends, and the likely impact of fairly certain future trends, such as the ageing of the population, the continued spread of HIV/AIDS in many regions, and the continuation of the epidemiological transition in developing countries. The results depend strongly on the assumption that future mortality trends in poor countries will have a relationship to economic and social development similar to those that have occurred in the higher-income countries. © 2006 Mathers and Loncar.",,"antiretrovirus agent; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; article; attitude to health; body mass; cancer; chronic respiratory tract disease; communicable disease; depression; diabetes mellitus; disease course; gastrointestinal disease; health care policy; Human immunodeficiency virus; income; injury; ischemic heart disease; maternal care; mortality; nutrition; perinatal morbidity; public health; register; risk assessment; smoking; theoretical model; traffic accident; tuberculosis; world health organization; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; adolescent; adult; aged; cause of death; child; developing country; epidemiology; health; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; infant; middle aged; newborn; preschool child; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Cause of Death; Child; Child, Preschool; Developing Countries; Epidemiology; HIV Infections; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Middle Aged; Mortality; Smoking; World Health",,,,,,"Murray, C.J.L., Lopez, A.D., Alternative visions of the future: Projecting mortality and disability, 1990-2020 (1996) The Global Burden of Disease, pp. 325-397. , Murray CJL, Lopez AD, editors.

Here, highlighting contributions from studies in model organisms, we review mammalian TOR complexes and the signaling branches they mediate. TOR is part of two distinct multiprotein complexes, TOR complex 1 (TORC1), which is sensitive to rapamycin, and TORC2, which is not. The physiological consequences of mammalian TORC1 dysregulation suggest that inhibitors of mammalian TOR may be useful in the treatment of cancer, cardiovascular disease, autoimmunity, and metabolic disorders. ©2006 Elsevier Inc.",,"actin; amino acid; guanosine triphosphatase; hamartin; initiation factor 4E; initiation factor 4E binding protein 1; insulin; mammalian target of rapamycin; oncoprotein; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase; phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate; protein beclin 1; protein kinase B; protein kinase LKB1; protein nf1; protein p53; protein S6k1; protein target of rapamycin kinase 1; protein target of rapamycin kinase 2; rapamycin; Ras protein; Rheb protein; somatomedin; target of rapamycin kinase; tuberin; tumor suppressor protein; unclassified drug; actin polymerization; aging; autoimmune disease; autophagy; cancer; cardiovascular disease; cell growth; cell metabolism; DNA damage; drug protein binding; drug sensitivity; energy consumption; environmental factor; genetic transcription; graft rejection; hamartoma; human; memory; metabolic disorder; negative feedback; nonhuman; priority journal; protein function; protein phosphorylation; protein variant; proto oncogene; review; ribosome; RNA translation; signal transduction; unspecified side effect; Aging; Animals; Cell Proliferation; Humans; Memory; Models, Biological; Protein Kinases; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Signal Transduction; Mammalia",,"amino acid, 65072-01-7; guanosine triphosphatase, 9059-32-9; insulin, 9004-10-8; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase, 115926-52-8; phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate, 94161-15-6; protein kinase B, 148640-14-6; rapamycin, 53123-88-9; target of rapamycin kinase, 171715-28-9; mTOR protein, EC 2.7.1.-; Protein Kinases, EC 2.7.1.37; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; target of rapamycin protein, S cerevisiae",,,,"Astrinidis, A., Cash, T.P., Hunter, D.S., Walker, C.L., Chernoff, J., Henske, E.P., Tuberin, the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 tumor suppressor gene product, regulates Rho activation, cell adhesion and migration (2002) Oncogene, 21, pp. 8470-8476; Audhya, A., Loewith, R., Parsons, A.B., Gao, L., Tabuchi, M., Zhou, H., Boone, C., Emr, S.D., Genome-wide lethality screen identifies new PI4,5P2 effectors that regulate the actin cytoskeleton (2004) EMBO J., 23, pp. 3747-3757; Ballif, B.A., Roux, P.P., Gerber, S.A., MacKeigan, J.P., Blenis, J., Gygi, S.P., Quantitative phosphorylation profiling of the ERK/p90 ribosomal S6 kinase-signaling cassette and its targets, the tuberous sclerosis tumor suppressors (2005) Proc.

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pilot project aims to assess the value of large-scale multi-dimensional analysis of these molecular characteristics in human cancer and to provide the data rapidly to the research community. Here we report the interim integrative analysis of DNA copy number, gene expression and DNA methylation aberrations in 206 glioblastomas - the most common type of adult brain cancer - and nucleotide sequence aberrations in 91 of the 206 glioblastomas. This analysis provides new insights into the roles of ERBB2, NF1 and TP53, uncovers frequent mutations of the phosphatidylinositol-3- OH kinase regulatory subunit gene PIK3R1, and provides a network view of the pathways altered in the development of glioblastoma. Furthermore, integration of mutation, DNA methylation and clinical treatment data reveals a link between MGMT promoter methylation and a hypermutator phenotype consequent to mismatch repair deficiency in treated glioblastomas, an observation with potential clinical implications. Together, these findings establish the feasibility and power of TCGA, demonstrating that it can rapidly expand knowledge of the molecular basis of cancer. ©2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Applications include replacements for hips, knees, teeth, tendons, and ligaments and repair for periodontal disease, maxillofacial reconstruction, augmentation and stabilization of the jaw bone, spinal fusion, and bone fillers after tumor surgery. Carbon coatings are thromboresistant and are used for prosthetic heart valves. The mechanisms of tissue bonding to bioactive ceramics are beginning to be understood, which can result in the molecular design of bioceramics for interfacial bonding with hard and soft tissues. Composites are being developed with high toughness and elastic modulus match with bone. Therapeutic treatment of cancer has been achieved by localized delivery of radioactive isotopes via glass beads. Development of standard test methods for prediction of long-term (20-year) mechanical reliability under load is still needed.","bioceramics; dental ceramics; interfaces; mechanics; structure","Alumina; Bioceramics; Bone; Carbon; Ceramic materials; Dental materials; Glass ceramics; Hydroxyapatite; Interfaces (materials); Mechanics; Repair; Structure (composition); Tissue; Zirconia; Dental ceramic; Interfacial bonding; Maxillofacial reconstruction; Mechanical reliability; Prosthetic heart valve; Standard test method; Therapeutic treatments; Tri-calcium phosphates; Bioactive glass",,,,,,,"Hench, L.L.; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of FloridaUnited States",,,"Blackwell Publishing Inc.",,,,,00027820,,JACTA,,"English","J Am Ceram Soc",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865737490

An estimated 1,268,000 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in the year 2001 and an estimated 553,400 Americans will die from cancer. Overall cancer incidence and death rates have continued to decrease in men and women since the early 1990s, and the decline in overall cancer mortality has been greater in recent years. Despite reductions in age-adjusted rates of cancer death, the total number of recorded cancer deaths in the US continues to increase, due to an aging and expanding population. Large disparities in cancer incidence and mortality across racial/ethnic groups continue. Black men and women experience higher incidence of cancer and poorer survival than white men and women. The disparity in survival reflects both diagnosis of cancer at later disease stages, and poorer survival within each stage of diagnosis.",,"adult; aged; aging; article; cancer diagnosis; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer staging; cancer statistics; cancer survival; Caucasian; controlled study; female; gender; human; male; medical record; negro; population growth; priority journal; race difference; United States; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; United States",,,,,,"(2000), National Cancer Institute.

Advances in protein engineering and materials science have contributed to novel nanoscale targeting approaches that may bring new hope to cancer patients. Several therapeutic nanocarriers have been approved for clinical use. However, to date, there are only a few clinically approved nanocarriers that incorporate molecules to selectively bind and target cancer cells. This review examines some of the approved formulations and discusses the challenges in translating basic research to the clinic.

In this study, we have refined the previously defined subtypes of breast tumors that could be distinguished by their distinct patterns of gene expression. A total of 115 malignant breast tumors were analyzed by hierarchical clustering based on patterns of expression of 534 ""intrinsic"" genes and shown to subdivide into one basal-like, one ERBB2-overexpressing, two luminal-like, and one normal breast tissue-like subgroup. The genes used for classification were selected based on their similar expression levels between pairs of consecutive samples taken from the same tumor separated by 15 weeks of neoadjuvant treatment. Similar cluster analyses of two published, independent data sets representing different patient cohorts from different laboratories, uncovered some of the same breast cancer subtypes. In the one data set that included information on time to development of distant metastasis, subtypes were associated with significant differences in this clinical feature. By including a group of tumors from BRCA1 carriers in the analysis, we found that this genotype predisposes to the basal tumor subtype. Our results strongly support the idea that many of these breast tumor subtypes represent biologically distinct disease entities.",,"article; breast carcinogenesis; breast carcinoma; cancer statistics; cluster analysis; cohort analysis; controlled study; DNA microarray; gene expression profiling; gene overexpression; genetic correlation; human; human tissue; metastasis; priority journal; proto oncogene; tumor classification; tumor suppressor gene; Breast Neoplasms; Carcinoma; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genes, BRCA1; Genes, erbB-2; Genotype; Humans; Life Tables; Neoadjuvant Therapy; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Proteins; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Survival Analysis",,"Neoplasm Proteins",,,,"Alizadeh, A.A., Eisen, M.B., Davis, R.E., Ma, C., Lossos, I.S., Rosenwald, A., Boldrick, J.C., Yu, X., (2000) Nature, 403, pp. 503-511; Chen, X., Cheung, S.T., So, S., Fan, S.T., Barry, C., Higgins, J., Lai, K.M., Ng, I.O., (2002) Mol.

In these applications, ac loss is a critical factor to determine the capacity of a refrigerator. And the ac losses of YBCO-NiW wires will be affected by the magnetic substrate. In this work, the self-field loss of the YBCO wire with the magnetic substrate is firstly measured, and compared with the numerical data. Moreover, the ac losses of a multi-wire YBCO-NiW conductor consisting of three wires are investigated for three transport modes. The main results show that the measured self-field loss of the wire is identical with the numerical ones. Accordingly, the reliability of the experimental and numerical methods is verified. Also, the ac losses of the conductor are in good agreement with the numerically calculated losses. As for the multi-wire conductor's total losses, the change of the direction of current in wires will not have an apparent influence on the total ac losses. © 2013 IEEE.","AC loss characteristics; Finite element model; Multi-wire conductor; YBCO-NiW wire","Finite element method; High temperature applications; High temperature superconductors; Magnetism; Numerical methods; Superconducting materials; Superconducting wire; Yttrium barium copper oxides; AC loss; Critical factors; Current direction; Experimental and numerical methods; Magnetic substrate; Multi-wire conductor; Numerical data; Transport modes; Wire",,,,,,"Yazawa, T., Koyanagi, K., Takahashi, M., Ono, M., Toba, K., Takigami, H., Urata, M., Shiohara, Y., Superconducting fault current limiter using high-resistive YBCO tapes (2008) Phys.

YBCO bulk was thus selected to investigate the feasibility. This bulk (diameter 32 mm, thickness 2.5 mm) was used to build a staggered-magnet array structure and a mock-up staggered undulator of period 5 mm and fixed gap 4 mm was designed for this test. The potential generation of a sinusoidal field was tested in a 3-T magnetization system with field-cooling magnetization (FCM). The practicability of a HTS undulator is discussed in regard to the possibility of correction of the local field, repetition of field trapping and long-term stability.

Our objective is to develop an HTS cyclotron with a compact body, high efficiency of output power, and high performance in heavy particle radiotherapy. In such an application, extremely high precision is required in the range 0.01% to 0.1% of magnetic field, both spatially and temporally. An isochronous field along with an azimuthally varying field is generated by an air-core pancake coil system during construction. Therefore, developing a technology for extremely high coil-winding accuracy is very important. In this study, we constructed an experimental model of a YBCO pancake coil using a high-precision coil winding machine. Then, the winding error in the radial and axial directions was experimentally evaluated using a pair of laser displacement meters and a surface roughness tester. We also developed a numerical simulation model to analyze the influence of winding error on the magnetic field distribution. The relationship between the winding error and the magnetic field of the meter-class YBCO coil assuming a real system was also evaluated by numerical simulation. © 2014 IEEE.","High-precision coil-winding machine; HTS wire; magnetic field accuracy; winding accuracy","Cyclotrons; Errors; High temperature applications; High temperature superconductors; Magnetic fields; Magnetism; Numerical models; Superconducting devices; Superconducting tapes; Surface roughness; Winding; Winding machines; Yttrium barium copper oxides; Azimuthally varying fields; Experimental modeling; High temperature superconducting tape; High-precision; HTS wires; Isochronous field; Laser displacement meter; Magnetic field distribution; Machine windings",,,,,,"Ueda, H., Fukuda, M., Hatanaka, K., Wang, T., Wang, X., Ishiyama, A., Noguchi, S., Miyahara, N., Conceptual design of next generation HTS cyclotron (2013) IEEE Trans.

Two primary components, in terms of size and expense, of an FEL system are an electron accelerator and undulator. Reducing undulator period without reducing its magnetic field would allow a reduction in the electron beam energy and potentially reduce the total cost and complexity of FELs. In this paper, finite-element modeling and experimental approaches were used to investigate the feasibility of using high-temperature superconducting (HTS) conductor to create tunable, liquid nitrogen cooled undulators with shorter periodicity. A prototype undulator with three periods was fabricated and tested. Hiperco 50 A structures with machined grooves were used as the magnetic cores. Commercial YBCO tapes were used to wind the magnetizing coils in the grooves of the magnetic core. The undulator was tested and measured in subcooled liquid nitrogen at 65 K. Peak magnetic fields of 0.77 T with a periodicity of 14 mm were attained. Our simulations indicate that by using optimally processed magnetic core and HTS wires, fields of 1 T or higher can be achieved.","High-temperature superconducting (HTS) undulator; Wiggler magnet; YBCO coils","Electron beam lithography; Finite element method; Free electron lasers; High temperature superconductors; Liquid nitrogen; Magnetic cores; Magnetic fields; Magnetism; Magnets; Nitrogen; Superconducting devices; Superconducting magnets; Wigglers; Yttrium barium copper oxides; Electron beam energy; Experimental approaches; High temperature superconducting; Monochromatic radiation; Sub-cooled liquid nitrogen; Wiggler magnets; X-ray free electron lasers; YBCO coils; Electrons",,,,,,"Nguyen, D.C., Russell, S., Moody, N., Free electron lasers - Theory and practice (2009) U.S. Part.

For their design, it is necessary to understand and predict the ac loss. This article analyzes the ac loss in magnet-like coils under dc bias contribution superimposed to the ac current. The analysis is based on a numerical model that takes the interaction between magnetization currents in all turns into account. The studied example is a stack of 32 pancake coils with 200 turns each made of thin tape, such as ReBCO-coated conductor. We present the current density, the instantaneous power loss, and loss per cycle. We have found that the loss increases with the dc bias current. The instantaneous power loss is the largest in the initial rise of the ac current. In the following cycles, the power loss is higher in the current increase than in the decrease. The loss per cycle is the largest at the end pancakes. In conclusion, the highest cooling power should be supplied to the top and bottom pancakes and during current rise, specially the initial one. The presented model has a high potential to predict the ac loss in magnet-size coils, useful for their design. © 2002-2011 IEEE.","AC loss; coated conductor; numerical modeling; pancake coil; stack of pancake coils; YBCO","Critical current density (superconductivity); Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Magnetic storage; Magnets; Numerical models; Yttrium barium copper oxides; AC loss; Coated conductors; Instantaneous power; Magnetization currents; Pancake coils; Rebco coated conductors; Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage systems; YBCO; Superconducting magnets",,,,,,"Ogasawara, T., Yasuköchi, K., Nose, S., Sekizawa, H., Effective resistance of current-carrying superconducting wire in oscillating magnetic fields 1: Single core composite conductor (1976) Cryogenics, 16 (1), pp. 33-38. , Jan; Brandt, E., Mikitik, G., Why an AC magnetic field shifts the irreversibility line in type-II superconductors (2002) Phys.

However, in a resistive-type superconducting fault current limiter that was manufactured with a current-limiting device produced with a 2G HTS coated conductor, the dimensions of the current-limiting device will be larger than those of other devices (e.g., a YBCO thin film and a BSCCO bulk) due to the physical characteristics of the 2G HTS coated conductor. Moreover, application of such resistive-type superconducting fault current limiter to an actual power system will produce high cooling expenses. Therefore, in this study, the electric-coupling condition for the reduction of the size of the superconducting current-limiting element was presented, a superconducting current-limiting element was manufactured using a 2G HTS coated conductor with a stainless-steel stabilization layer, and the manufactured superconducting current-limiting element was applied to the electric-coupling condition to evaluate its stability and current-limiting performance under such condition. The electric-coupling condition that was presented in this paper is the series connection of the primary coil (N1) and the secondary coil (N2), and the parallel connection of the secondary coil and the superconductive element. © 2013 IEEE.","2Generation (2G) high-temperature superconductivity (HTS) coated conductor; Current-limiting element; current-limiting performance; winding direction","Barium; Copper; Critical current density (superconductivity); Electric connectors; Electric fault currents; Electric windings; Fault current limiters; Limiters; Manufacture; Stabilization; Stainless steel; Strontium; Superconducting devices; Thin films; Winding; Yttrium barium copper oxides; Coated conductors; Current limiting; Current limiting device; High critical current densities; High-temperature superconductivity; Physical characteristics; Resistive type superconducting fault current limiter; Winding direction; Superconducting fault current limiters",,,,,,"Paul, W., Chen, M., Lakner, M., Rhyner, J., Braun, D., Lanz, W., Fault current limiter based on high temperature superconductors different concepts, test results, simulations, application (2001) Physica C, 354 (1-4), pp. 27-33. , May; Du, H.-I., Kim, Y.-J., Lee, D.-H., Han, B.-S., Song, S.-S., Kim, M.-J., Han, S.-C., Study on maximum operating condition of resistive type SFCL using YBCO coated conductor (2011) IEEE Trans.

It was found that by increasing the pinning energy dispersion through nanoparticle addition the relevant changes in the temperature T variation of the normalized magnetization relaxation rate S appear at relatively high temperatures (T ∼ 65 K for H = 2 kOe), owing to the inhibition of double vortex-kink formation. This indicates that the often observed S(T) maximum at low T (around 30 K) is not related to the excitation of double vortex kinks and super-kinks in specimens with columnar defects, as previously believed. The low-T S(T) maximum is present in the case of strongly pinned specimens without nanorods, as well, and depends on the film thickness, which definitely shows that it is caused by thermo-magnetic instabilities, as recently suggested. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Appl. Phys. 113, 036908 (2013)), where we reported comprehensive analysis of inter-grain connectivity (A F), pinning, percolation threshold (Pc), and anisotropy (γ) in a series of ex-situ processed MgB2, we address the same issues in in-situ processed samples. MgB2 samples with stoichiometric composition, excess Mg (5wt. %) and further 3wt. % addition of various non-carbon based additives like nano-Ag, nano-Ni, and YBCO are synthesised by the in-situ route. Detailed investigations of X-ray diffraction, magnetization (M), and resistivity (ρ) as a function of temperature (T) and field (B) in the range 5-300K and 0-8T are carried out in all the samples. The resistive superconducting onset Tcon∼38.6±0.3K and offset (where ρ goes to zero) Tc0∼38.1±0.3K of the samples stay nearly unchanged. The inter-grain connectivity (AF) of the samples varies between 11%-20%. All the additives result in a critical current density (Jc) higher than the stoichiometric MgB2 sample, where the highest values (e.g., Jc(1T, 5K)∼1.2 × 10 9A/m2) are observed for the sample with 5wt. % excess Mg. The major findings based on quantitative analysis of ρ (T, B) and J c (B, T) data in all the samples are: (1) along with previously studied ex-situ samples, the Jc(AF) shows a significant increase at AF∼7%; (2) the irreversibility lines lie lower than the characteristic Tc0(B) lines in the B-T phase diagram; (3) a universal core pinning (δl- and/or δTc- type) mechanism is revealed in the entire T range 5-30K; and (4) typical values of P c∼0.57±0.04 is indicative of weak link networks. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.",,"Carbon; X ray diffraction; Yttrium barium copper oxides; Comprehensive analysis; Inter-grain; Irreversibility lines; Percolation thresholds; Stoichiometric compositions; Synthesised; Typical values; Weak links; Superconductivity",,,,,"CSIR, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research","Nagamatsu, J., Nakagawa, N., Muranaka, T., Zenitani, Y., Akimitsu, J., (2001) Nature, 410, p. 63. , 10.1038/35065039; Shi, Z.X., Pradhan, A.K., Tokunaga, M., Yamazaki, K., Tamegai, T., Takano, Y., Togano, K., Ihara, H., (2003) Phys.

For this reason, a well c-axis-oriented YBCO crystal with a size of 34 mm in diameter was successfully fabricated by modified melt-growth. First, our findings show that the thermal stability of the film-seed could be enhanced by introducing an intermediate mini-pellet between film and bulk. Furthermore, we present evidence to prove that the serious liquid loss could be suppressed by the CeO2 addition. Finally, the interesting question we addressed is the nature of the formation of distinctive growing macrostructures, such as ambiguous growth facet lines, and the corner-concaved a-b plane. Most importantly, apart from YBCO, our new approach strongly suggests the possibility of synthesizing large crystals for more attractive members in its family, i.e., chemically doped YBCO materials, being unsuccessful by the prior art crystal growth methods. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",,"Chemically doped; Effective approaches; Large crystal; Macrostructures; Neutron scattering experiments; New approaches; Prior arts; Yttrium barium copper oxides",,,,,"51072115, NSFC, National Natural Science Foundation of China; 51172143, NSFC, National Natural Science Foundation of China","Campbell, A.M., Cardwell, D.A., (1997) Cryogenics, 37, pp. 567-575; Werfel, F.N., Floegel-Delor, U., Rothfeld, R., Riedel, T., Goebel, B., Wippich, D., Schirrmeister, P., (2012) Supercond.

The acceleration and resonance frequencies were experimentally measured, and the stiffness and damping coefficients were evaluated for dynamic stability. Results indicate that the levitation stiffness is closely related to the field-cooling-height and sample positioning.

For anisotropic phononic crystal, band gaps are dependent upon not only the periodic lattice but also the orientation of orthotropic spheres. When the orientation changes continuously, for example, rotating these spherical inclusions around a spatial axis, the pass band and the forbidden band change as a result. These changes include the location and width of band gaps, and even appearing and disappearing of band gaps. The plane wave expansion method is used to reduce the band gap problem considered to a mathematical eigenvalue problem. The numerical simulation is given for YBCO/Epoxy composite. The location and the width of band gaps are estimated for different rotating angles and filling fractions. The influence of orientation of anisotropic spheres on band gaps is discussed based on these numerical results. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","band gap; orientation; orthotropy; phononic crystal; plane wave expansion","Eigenvalue problem; Orientation changes; Orthotropy; Periodic lattices; Phononic Crystal; Plane wave expansion method; Plane-wave expansions; Spherical inclusion; Anisotropy; Crystal orientation; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Phonons; Spheres; Three dimensional; Wave propagation; Energy gap",,,,,"10672019, NSFC, National Natural Science Foundation of China","Wang, G., Yu, D., Wen, J., Liu, Y., Wen, X., One-dimensional phononic crystals with locally resonant structures (2004) Phys.

These domains arise from instabilities in the vortex structure within a narrow region of tilted magnetic fields at small angles from the in-plane direction. By comparing the experimental and theoretically derived vortex phase diagrams we infer that the stripe domains emerge from a first-order phase transition of the vortex structure. The size of domains containing vortices of certain orientations is controlled by the balance between the vortex stray field energy and the positive energy of the domain boundaries. Our results confirm the existence of the kinked vortex chain phase in an anisotropic high temperature superconductor and reveal a sharp transition in the state of this phase resulting in regular vortex domains. © 2014 American Physical Society.",,"Anisotropy; High temperature superconductors; Yttrium barium copper oxides; Domain boundary; First-order phase transitions; In-plane direction; Positive energies; Sharp transition; Tilted magnetic fields; Vortex phase diagram; Vortex structures; Vortex flow",,,,,"DOE, U.S. Department of Energy","Abrikosov, A.A., (1957) J.

It also asks: what is sociology for legal theorists, especially for jurists pursuing theoretical inquiries about the nature of law as doctrine, ideas, and reasoning? And, by contrast, it asks, what is sociology for sociologists? The chapter attempts to illustrate that sociologists can even help to clarify the very nature of theoretical legal studies. It begins by presenting the conceptualization of sociology in association with legal theory. In addition, it considers the views of sociologists' contemporary debates about the nature of their scholarly enterprise. It also describes Ehrlich's equation of legal theory with sociology of law. Legal theory is mainly the focus of jurists and sociolegal scholars who may occupy different positions in connection with the debates considered in this chapter. © Oxford University Press, 2006.

The chapter argues that, traditionally, the social territory belonged to literature and philosophy. A challenge was then raised by science especially in the nineteenth century. Then, especially in the twentieth century, social science developed so as to turn a binary contrast into a triangular one. Sociology had three sources in Western thought: one literary (political philosophy), one quasi-scientific (the philosophy of history), and one scientific (biology). It is no accident that both sociology and social policy were placed first at the London School of Economics, the Fabian institution invented and fostered by Sidney and Beatrice Webb in 1895. © The British Academy 2005.

Methodology/approach - Conceptual overview. Practical implications - By reviewing the range of social functions served by diagnosis, and the similarly wide assortment of social forces that shape diagnostic categories, this chapter pushes social scientists and theorists to consider diagnosis as a cornerstone to the understanding of health, illness, and disease. Originality/value of paper - Building on Brown's earlier call for a sociology of diagnosis, this chapter sets forth potential parameters for this field. It defines how the study of diagnosis is dissipated across myriad areas of scholarship, including medicalization, disease theory, ethics, classification theory, and history of medicine. Extirpating diagnosis and revealing it for specific discussion provides an opportunity to study topics such as illness experiences, health social movements, and disease recognition from a different and rich perspective.

To have a balanced and sustainable economy, which is behind all politic means and factors including development strategies and investment policies of a country, depends on a wholistic development. One of the elements of wholistic development is Rural Development works. To have a successful work on the rural areas, it is important to analyse the 'Rural Sociology' very good and to use the technology supported applications in these analysis. In this context, by using the Geographical Information Systems (GIS) while identifying the area, identifying route and identifying re-arranging points at rural settlements is possible, observing and identifying the agricultural investments and the projections in years of these investments can be realized. As a result, in this study, how the sociology planning should be done by the integration of technology based on geographical information systems and to which extend the rural social can be affected as a result of these studies has been shown. In this study, the great benefits of the use of contemporary technology and usage planning has been explained. © 2015 IEEE.","Rural Development; Rural Sociology; Rural Sociology and GIS",,,,,,,"Albayrak, A., (2000) Bir Medeniyetin Kuramcisi Olarak Ibni 1-laldun, , Uludag Univ.

""Genericity"" and ""fractality"" do not characterize only the concept of mechanism; they also characterize that of ""computational objects,"" these being the fundamental components of agent-based modeling, which is the most flexible method for the formal design of models of mechanisms. The quantitative-oriented variant of the analytical sociology research program is clearly committed to the formulation of generative models mimicking mechanisms, and looks for generality in the operation of similar mechanisms in different social domains. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Analytical sociology; Concept of mechanism; Fractals; Generic instruments; Problem shifts",,,,,,,"Abbott, A., (2001) Chaos of Disciplines, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Elster, J., (2007) Explaining Social Behaviour: More Nuts and Bolts for the Social Sciences, , Cambridge University Press, New York; Elster, J., Excessive ambitions (2009) Capitalism and Society, 4 (2); Fararo, T.J., (1989) The Meaning of General Theoretical Sociology: Tradition and Formalisation, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Fararo, T.J., (2001) Social Action Systems: Foundation and Synthesis in Sociological Theory, , Praeger, Westport, CT; Feldman, D.P., (2012) Chaos and Fractals: An Elementary Introduction, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Hayward, S., Agent-based modelling with wavelets and an evolutionary artificial neural network: applications to CAC 40 forecasting (2006) Econophysics of Stock and Other Markets, pp. 163-174. , E.

It proposes QNA as a way to measure some of the core concepts of analytical sociology, notably actors, actions, and their relations and networks. QNA is a social science technique for the analysis of narrative texts. It is QNA's emphasis on actors, actions, and relations that strikes a sympathetic chord with analytical sociology. QNA involves a series of steps that are reviewed to explain how QNA works and what it allows researchers to do. QNA delivers highly disaggregated data, at the level of actors, their actions in time and space, and their relations. QNA's concern with narrative translates into a concern with events. QNA delivers quantitative data that can be used as variables in traditional, regression-based, statistical models. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Analytical sociology; Georgia lynchings project; Quantitative narrative analysis (QNA)",,,,,,,"Ayers, E.L., (1992) The Promise of the New South: Life after Reconstruction, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Braudel, F., (1980) On History, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Cameron, J., (1970) A Time of Terror: A Survivor's Story, , Black Classic Press, Baltimore, MD; Dowd Hall, J., (1993) Revolt Against Chivalry: Jessie Daniel Ames and the Women's Campaign against Lynching, , Columbia University Press, New York; Ellis, M.L., Rain Down Fire"": the lynching of Sam Hose (1992), Doctoral dissertation.

We specifically examine contributions to the study of taxation that illuminate core issues in the sociology of contemporary capitalism, including the causes of poverty and inequality in rich countries and of inequality between rich and poor countries. Research on developed countries suggests that tax policy changes are important for explaining rising income inequality, tax policies may structure durable inequalities of race and gender, and earnings-conditional tax subsidies may alleviate poverty more effectively and with less stigma than means-tested social spending. Scholars also find the most generous welfare states rely the most heavily on regressive taxes, although there is disagreement over how this association arises. Comparative research on developing countries shows consumption taxes are more conducive to growth than taxes on income, tax-financed spending benefits growth if it is spent on productive investments, and taxation strengthened democracy and state building in medieval and early modern Europe. However, there is disagreement as to whether taxation contributes to state building in contemporary developing countries and whether foreign aid undermines democracy by undermining taxation. These questions are the focus of considerable current research. © Copyright ©2014 by Annual Reviews.

Demography and sociology share a focus on group behaviour. While demography is concerned with the structure and development of human populations that are governed by collective reproductive practices and environmental factors, sociology deals more generally with all forms of social behaviour, institutions, and organization. In principle, the value of systematic means of studying these issues can hardly be in doubt. Even so, the formal approaches and methods of current demography or sociology have only rarely been applied to any aspect of Hellenic studies. Conventional disciplinary boundaries and normative preferences for 'humanistic' perspectives are the most obvious culprits. © Oxford University Press 2009.

Religion has also made a comeback in social sciences as an incontrovertible part of social life. This chapter provides the coordinates for a better mapping of religion, alongside the classical tradition in political sociology, considered as a legitimate and unavoidable object of study for the discipline. These coordinates must include social forms and experiences, issues of power and control within and over religious organizations, the link between religion and politics and the development of individual religious behaviours in social contexts, and it should also favour a comparative perspective. This chapter explores first the issue of the definition of religion as an epistemological challenge for political sociology before moving on to review and contrast North American and European scholarship on religious developments in modern societies. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Position religion occupies in political sociology, a complicated issue; Religion's diverse modes of expression; Religion, in its own right capillarized within the social/political; Religion, making a comeback as an incontrovertible part of social life; Religion, on belief/faith, practices/rituals linking the sacred; Secularization and individualization, and European/North American ways of religion; Social forms and experiences, power/control over religious organizations; Sociology of religion, middle of a paradigmatic crisis",,,,,,,"Ammerman, N., Everyday Religion: Observing Modern Religious Lives (2007), (ed.)

In the first, I discuss the presence and absence of the concept of ""social relations"" in social sciences and focus on ""ethnic relations."" Then, I analyse theways inwhich the theoretical problems of ethnic relations are conceptualized in sociology. Finally, I offer my own suggestions. Why is it worth dealing with concepts of interactions and social relations at all, especially with respect to macrosocial phenomena (such as ""ethnic issues"") First, it seems to me that these are some of sociology's most basic concepts. Second, the relational and interactionist current in contemporary sociology offers some important inspirations relating to the analysis of macrocultural phenomena. I suggest to follow Randall Collins' ideas and seek the ""microfoundations"" of macrosocial phenomena in the chains of interaction rituals present at the foundation of society as such. I intend to avoid such a sociological approach to ethnicity which calls all ethnic phenomena ""ethnic relations"" but in fact deals mainly with individual groups, types of structured ethnic order or attitudes. Actually, ethnic order rests on the interactionist understanding of the social relations between ethnic actors. It is these relations which dynamize social order.","Basic concepts of sociology; Ethnic relations; Individualism; Interactions; Relationism; Social relations",,,,,,,"Banton, M., (1965) Roles.

The social sciences had an effect almost comparable to that of religion in earlier periods. On the other hand, legal thought has tended to reflect the trends to be found in sociology. The sociology of law was dominated by sociological jurisprudence. In the late 1990s, a new class of sociological jurisprudence was announced: realistic socio-legal theory.

Phases of expansion (1950-67), revolt (1968-75) and uncertainty (1976-2000) are described. Analysis of the professors-their origins, careers and fame-is presented.

This article notes some of the reasons why sociology has tended to ignore history but asserts that scholarly explorations of STS topics, and in particular the study of technological change, provide many opportunities for engagements with history. A number of research issues are presented that focus on such topics as the rise of the nation-state, changes in the occupational structure, and recast gender roles. The article concludes that a historically informed study of technology and technological change will add an important dimension to a key sociological insight, that people actively create the forces shaping their lives while also being constrained and molded by these creations.","History; Social constructionism; Sociology; Technological change; Technological determinism; Technology","Economic and social effects; History; Natural sciences; Social aspects; Science and technology; Social constructionism; Sociology; Technological change; Technological determination; Technology",,,,,,"Abrams, P., (1982) Historical Sociology, , Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press; Attewell, P., Skill and occupational changes in U.S. manufacturing (1992) Technology and the Future of Work, , In P.

It explains that the author has been a sociologist of education for 45 years since 1964. It suggests that the establishment of the sociology of education (SoE) as an academic field in India started in 1964, with the appointment of the Education Commission which had the mandate to advise the government on how education could be used as an instrument of national development. This chapter highlights the accomplishments of Commission Member Secretary Shri J.P.

The study of the sociology of law leans on certain critical and basic assumptions. The basic propositions, which are also believed to be important to the thought and research of most sociologists of law, are explained. The chapter specifically addresses the question: What place does the concept of legal culture have in the theoretical framework of the sociology of law? It is assumed that legal culture is, or can be, extremely volatile. The basic change is a change in legal culture: in attitudes toward ageing, and (more generally) rights consciousness, spreading from men to women, from young to old, from whites to blacks, from straights to gays, and then even more broadly in society.

In particular, it looks at the history and the present state of Roman law and society studies. It then addresses some of the problems of and prospects for the sociology of Roman law. The problem of Roman law's relation to society, as formulated by Bruce Frier, is also described in terms of the current opposition between positivist and sociological ideas of law and jurisprudence. It is noted that the sociology of law offers a comprehensive, comparative, and realistic perspective on socio-legal phenomena and their inter-relations in Ancient Rome which is not always evident if one pays attention only to Roman sources and Roman law doctrine. © Oxford University Press, 2006.

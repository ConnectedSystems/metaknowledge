AB  - ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters constitute a very large and ubiquitous
      superfamily of membrane proteins. They are responsible for ATP hydrolysis driven 
      translocation of countless substrates. Being a very old and diverse group of
      proteins present in all organisms they share a common feature, which is the
      presence of an evolutionary conservative nucleotide binding domain (NBD) - the
      engine that drives the transport. Another common domain is a transmembrane domain
      (TMD) which consists of several membrane-spanning helices. This part of protein
      is substrate-specific, thus it is much more variable. ABC transporters are known 
      for driving drug efflux in many pathogens and cancer cells, therefore they are
      the subject of extensive studies. There are many examples of conferring a drug
      resistance phenotype in fungal pathogens by ABC transporters, however, little is 
      known about these proteins in dermatophytes - a group of fungi causing
      superficial mycoses. So far only a single ABC transporter has been extensively
      studied in this group of pathogens. We analyzed available genomic sequences of
      seven dermatophyte species in order to provide an insight into dermatophyte ABC
      protein inventory. Phylogenetic studies of ABC transporter genes and their
      products were conducted and included ABC transporters of other fungi. Our results
      show that each dermatophyte genome studied possesses a great variety of ABC
      transporter genes. Detailed analysis of selected genes and their products
      indicates that relatively recent duplication of ABC transporter genes could lead 
      to novel substrate specificity.

TI  - Assessment of the ABC/2 Method of Epidural Hematoma Volume Measurement as
      Compared to Computer-Assisted Planimetric Analysis.
PG  - 5-11
LID - 10.1177/1099800415577634 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Epidural hematoma volume (EDHV) is an independent
      predictor of prognosis in patients with epidural hematoma (EDH) and plays a
      central role in treatment decision making. This study's objective was to
      determine the accuracy and reliability of the widely used volume measurement
      method ABC/2 in estimating EDHV by comparing it to the computer-assisted
      planimetric method. METHODS: A data set of computerized tomography (CT) scans of 
      35 patients with EDH was evaluated to determine the accuracy of ABC/2 method,
      using computer-assisted planimetric technique to establish the reference
      criterion of EDHV for each patient. Another data set was constructed by randomly 
      selecting 5 patients then replicating each case twice to yield 15 patients.
      Intra- and interobserver reliability were evaluated by asking four observers to
      independently estimate EDHV for the latter data set using the ABC/2 method.
      RESULTS: Estimation of EDHV using the ABC/2 method showed high intra- and
      interobserver reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient = .99). These
      estimates were closely correlated with planimetric measures (r = .99). But the
      ABC/2 method generally overestimated EDHV, especially in the nonellipsoid-like
      group. The difference between the ABC/2 measures and planimetric measures was
      statistically significant (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The ABC/2 method could be used 
      for EDHV measurement, which would contribute to treatment decision making as well
      as clinical outcome prediction. However, clinicians should be aware that the
      ABC/2 method results in a general volume overestimation. Future studies focusing 
      on justification of the technique to improve its accuracy would be of practical
      value.

TI  - The Assessment of Burden of COPD (ABC) Scale: A Reliable and Valid Questionnaire.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - The newly developed Assessment of Burden of COPD (ABC) scale is a 14-item
      self-administered questionnaire which measures the physical, psychological,
      emotional and/or social burden as experienced by patients with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The ABC scale is part of the ABC tool that 
      visualises the outcomes of the questionnaire. The aim of this study was to assess
      the reliability and construct validity of the ABC scale. This multi-centre survey
      study was conducted in the practices of 19 general practitioners and 9
      pulmonologists throughout the Netherlands. Next to the ABC scale, patients with
      COPD completed the Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Reliability
      analyses were performed with data from 162 cases. Cronbach's alpha was 0.91 for
      the total scale. Test-retest reliability, measured at a two week interval (n =
      137), had an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.92. Analyses for convergent
      validity were performed with data from 133 cases. Discriminant and known-groups
      validity was analysed with data from 162 cases. The ABC scale total score had a
      strong correlation with the total score of the SGRQ (r = 0.72, p < 0.001) but a
      weak correlation with the forced expired volume in 1 second predicted (r = -0.28,
      p < 0.001). Subgroups with more severe disease, defined by GOLD-stage, frequency 
      of exacerbations, activity level and depression scored statistically
      significantly (p < 0.05) worse on almost all domains of the ABC scale than the
      less severe subgroups. The ABC scale seems a valid and reliable tool with good
      discriminative properties.

TI  - CARMA1- and MyD88-dependent activation of Jun/ATF-type AP-1 complexes is a
      hallmark of ABC diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.
LID - blood-2015-07-655647 [pii]
AB  - A hallmark of the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of the activated B-cell
      (ABC) type, a molecular subtype characterized by adverse outcome, is constitutive
      activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB, which controls expression of
      genes promoting cellular survival and proliferation. Much less, however, is known
      about the role of the transcription factor AP-1 in ABC DLBCL. Here we show that
      AP-1, like NF-kappaB, was controlled by constitutive activation of the B-cell
      receptor and/or toll-like receptor signaling pathways in ABC DLBCL cell lines. In
      contrast to germinal center B-cell (GCB) DLBCL, ABC DLBCL cell lines expressed
      high levels of the AP-1 family members c-Jun, JunB and JunD, which formed
      heterodimeric complexes with the AP-1 family members ATF2, ATF3 and ATF7.
      Inhibition of these complexes by a dominant negative approach led to impaired
      growth of a majority of ABC DLBCL cell lines. Individual silencing of c-Jun, ATF2
      or ATF3 decreased cellular survival, and revealed a c-Jun/ATF2-dependent control 
      of ATF3 expression. As a consequence, ATF3 expression was much higher in ABC
      versus GCB DLBCL cell lines. Samples derived from DLBCL patients showed a clear
      trend towards high and nuclear ATF3 expression in nodal DLBCL of the non-GC, or
      ABC subtype. These findings identify the activation of AP-1 complexes of the
      Jun/ATF-type as an important element controlling the growth of ABC DLBCL.

TI  - Gastric Cancer Screening by Combined Assay for Serum Anti-Helicobacter pylori IgG
      Antibody and Serum Pepsinogen Levels - The ABC Method.
PG  - suppl 13-8
LID - 10.1159/000441742 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection and gastric atrophy are both risk 
      factors for gastric cancer. Recently it has been found that X-ray examination for
      gastric cancer screening does not have much effect on the detection rate for
      gastric cancer in Japan. A candidate for a new mass screening for gastric cancer,
      the ABC method, using the combination assay of Hp and serum pepsinogen, was
      useful for identifying the development of gastric cancer in high-risk and
      low-risk populations. People with higher cancer risk are recommended to receive
      endoscopy. The ABC method was carried out as a gastric cancer mass-screening on
      the initiative of Nishitokyo Medical Association in Nishitokyo city from 2011.
      This paper reviewed the present status of gastric cancer screening using the ABC 
      method, including the latest results of our ongoing screening. SUMMARY: We report
      results for 36,627 individuals from 2011 to 2013. Among them, 16,965 received
      blood examination for the ABC method. Of those, 8,083 planned to undergo
      endoscopic examination according to stratification of the risk for the
      development of gastric cancer. In fact, a total of 2,911 individuals underwent
      endoscopic examination. Gastric cancer was detected in 65 patients, including 52 
      (80%) diagnosed with early gastric cancer. The ABC method was not organized
      screening but opportunistic screening. X-ray examination was the organized
      screening that was ongoing during the same period. Detection cost for 1 gastric
      cancer case using the ABC method was cheaper than the conventional X-ray
      screening method ( yen1,267,452 vs. yen2,807,763). KEY MESSAGES: Although further
      large epidemiological studies are required, the ABC method might be positioned as
      an effective mass screening for gastric cancer.

      multidrug resistance: A review of the past decade.

AB  - Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a serious phenomenon employed by cancer cells which
      hampers the success of cancer pharmacotherapy. One of the common mechanisms of
      MDR is the overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux transporters in
      cancer cells such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1), multidrug resistance-associated
      protein 2 (MRP2/ABCC2), and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) that
      limits the prolonged and effective use of chemotherapeutic drugs. Researchers
      have found that developing inhibitors of ABC efflux transporters as
      chemosensitizers could overcome MDR. But the clinical trials have shown that most
      of these chemosensitizers are merely toxic and only show limited or no benefits
      to cancer patients, thus new inhibitors are being explored. Recent findings also 
      suggest that efflux pumps of the ABC transporter family are subject to epigenetic
      gene regulation. In this review, we summarize recent findings of the role of ABC 
      efflux transporters in MDR.

TI  - Self-assembly of ABC triblock copolymers under 3D soft confinement: a Monte Carlo
      study.
PG  - 965-72
LID - 10.1039/c5sm02079d [doi]
AB  - Under three-dimensional (3D) soft confinement, block copolymers can self-assemble
      into unique nanostructures that cannot be fabricated in an un-confined space.
      Linear ABC triblock copolymers containing three chemically distinct polymer
      blocks possess relatively complex chain architecture, which can be a promising
      candidate for the 3D confined self-assembly. In the current study, the Monte
      Carlo technique was applied in a lattice model to study the self-assembly of ABC 
      triblock copolymers under 3D soft confinement, which corresponds to the
      self-assembly of block copolymers confined in emulsion droplets. We demonstrated 
      how to create various nanostructures by tuning the symmetry of ABC triblock
      copolymers, the incompatibilities between different block types, and solvent
      properties. Besides common pupa-like and bud-like nanostructures, our simulations
      predicted various unique self-assembled nanostructures, including a
      striped-pattern nanoparticle with intertwined A-cages and C-cages, a pyramid-like
      nanoparticle with four Janus B-C lamellae adhered onto its four surfaces, an
      ellipsoidal nanoparticle with a dumbbell-like A-core and two Janus B-C lamellae
      and a Janus B-C ring surrounding the A-core, a spherical nanoparticle with a
      A-core and a helical Janus B-C stripe around the A-core, a cubic nanoparticle
      with a cube-shape A-core and six Janus B-C lamellae adhered onto the surfaces of 
      the A-cube, and a spherical nanoparticle with helical A, B and C structures, from
      the 3D confined self-assembly of ABC triblock copolymers. Moreover, the formation
      mechanisms of some typical nanostructures were also examined by the variations of
      the contact numbers with time and a series of snapshots at different Monte Carlo 
      times. It is found that ABC triblock copolymers usually aggregate into a loose
      aggregate at first, and then the microphase separation between A, B and C blocks 
      occurs, resulting in the formation of various nanostructures.

TI  - Coexpression of Multiple ABC-Transporters is Strongly Associated with Treatment
      Response in Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
PG  - 242-7
LID - 10.1002/pbc.25785 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To analyze whether expression of ABC-transporters is associated with 
      remission rate and long-term outcome in a prospective clinical trial of childhood
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML). PROCEDURE: The expression of four ABC-transporter
      genes (ABCA3 encoding drug transporter ABCA3, ABCB1 encoding multidrug resistance
      protein 1, ABCC3 encoding multidrug resistance-associated protein 3, and ABCG2
      encoding breast cancer resistance protein) was measured by TaqMan real time
      polymerase chain reaction in pretreatment samples from 112 children with AML.
      Patients were treated according to multicenter study AML-Berlin, Frankfurt,
      Munich (BFM) 2004. RESULTS: ABCC3 (P = 0.009) and ABCG2 (P = 0.03) were
      associated with a lower chance to achieve remission after the first course of
      chemotherapy. ABCC3 was associated with lower relapse free survival (RFS) (P =
      0.02). ABCG2 was expressed at higher levels in subtypes of AML with favorable
      outcome but within standard- and high-risk patients, it was associated with poor 
      outcome (P = 0.02). A strong association was observed between the number of
      overexpressed ABC-transporters and the chance to achieve remission (P = 0.01) or 
      the chance of RFS (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The intensive treatment regimen of
      AML-BFM 2004 did not readily overcome drug resistance caused by ABC-transporters.
      Inhibition of ABC-transporters might be particularly useful in patients who
      express multiple of these genes.

AB  - ABC transporters form the largest of all transporter families, and their
      structural study has made tremendous progress over recent years. However, despite
      such advances, the precise mechanisms that determine the energy-coupling between 
      ATP hydrolysis and the conformational changes following substrate binding remain 
      to be elucidated. Here, we present our thermodynamic analysis for both ABC
      importers and exporters, and introduce the two new concepts of
      differential-binding energy and elastic conformational energy into the
      discussion. We hope that the structural analysis of ABC transporters will
      henceforth take thermodynamic aspects of transport mechanisms into account as
      well.

TI  - LmABCB3, an atypical mitochondrial ABC transporter essential for Leishmania major
      virulence, acts in heme and cytosolic iron/sulfur clusters biogenesis.
PG  - 7
LID - 10.1186/s13071-015-1284-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mitochondria play essential biological functions including the
      synthesis and trafficking of porphyrins and iron/sulfur clusters (ISC), processes
      that in mammals involve the mitochondrial ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporters
      ABCB6 and ABCB7, respectively. The mitochondrion of pathogenic protozoan
      parasites such as Leishmania is a promising goal for new therapeutic approaches. 
      Leishmania infects human macrophages producing the neglected tropical disease
      known as leishmaniasis. Like most trypanosomatid parasites, Leishmania is
      auxotrophous for heme and must acquire porphyrins from the host. METHODS:
      LmABCB3, a new Leishmania major protein with significant sequence similarity to
      human ABCB6/ABCB7, was identified and characterized using bioinformatic tools.
      Fluorescent microscopy was used to determine its cellular localization, and its
      level of expression was modulated by molecular genetic techniques. Intracellular 
      in vitro assays were used to demonstrate its role in amastigotes replication, and
      an in vivo mouse model was used to analyze its role in virulence. Functional
      characterization of LmABCB3 was carried out in Leishmania promastigotes and
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Structural analysis of LmABCB3 was performed using
      molecular modeling software. RESULTS: LmABCB3 is an atypical ABC half-transporter
      that has a unique N-terminal extension not found in any other known ABC protein. 
      This extension is required to target LmABCB3 to the mitochondrion and includes a 
      potential metal-binding domain. We have shown that LmABCB3 interacts with
      porphyrins and is required for the mitochondrial synthesis of heme from a host
      precursor. We also present data supporting a role for LmABCB3 in the biogenesis
      of cytosolic ISC, essential cofactors for cell viability in all three kingdoms of
      life. LmABCB3 fully complemented the severe growth defect shown in yeast lacking 
      ATM1, an orthologue of human ABCB7 involved in exporting from the mitochondria a 
      gluthatione-containing compound required for the generation of cytosolic ISC.
      Indeed, docking analyzes performed with a LmABCB3 structural model using
      trypanothione, the main thiol in this parasite, as a ligand showed how both,
      LmABCB3 and yeast ATM1, contain a similar thiol-binding pocket. Additionally, we 
      show solid evidence suggesting that LmABCB3 is an essential gene as dominant
      negative inhibition of LmABCB3 is lethal for the parasite. Moreover, the
      abrogation of only one allele of the gene did not impede promastigote growth in
      axenic culture but prevented the replication of intracellular amastigotes and the
      virulence of the parasites in a mouse model of cutaneous leishmaniasis.
      CONCLUSIONS: Altogether our results present the previously undescribed LmABCB3 as
      an unusual mitochondrial ABC transporter essential for Leishmania survival
      through its role in the generation of heme and cytosolic ISC. Hence, LmABCB3
      could represent a novel target to combat leishmaniasis.

AB  - The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transporter proteins is important
      for detoxification of xenobiotics. For example, ABC transporters from the
      multidrug-resistance protein (MRP) subfamily are important for excretion of
      polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their metabolites. Effects of
      chemicals in the water soluble organic fraction of relatively fresh oil sands
      process affected water (OSPW) from Base Mine Lake (BML-OSPW) and aged OSPW from
      Pond 9 (P9-OSPW) on the activity of MRP transporters were investigated in vivo by
      use of Japanese medaka at the fry stage of development. Activities of MRPs were
      monitored by use of the lipophilic dye calcein, which is transported from cells
      by ABC proteins, including MRPs. To begin to identify chemicals that might
      inhibit activity of MRPs, BML-OSPW and P9-OSPW were fractionated into acidic,
      basic, and neutral fractions by use of mixed-mode sorbents. Chemical compositions
      of fractions were determined by use of ultrahigh resolution orbitrap mass
      spectrometry in ESI(+) and ESI(-) mode. Greater amounts of calcein were retained 
      in fry exposed to BML-OSPW at concentration equivalents greater than 1x (i.e.,
      full strength). The neutral and basic fractions of BML-OSPW, but not the acidic
      fraction, caused greater retention of calcein. Exposure to P9-OSPW did not affect
      the amount of calcein in fry. Neutral and basic fractions of BML-OSPW contained
      relatively greater amounts of several oxygen-, sulfur, and nitrogen-containing
      chemical species that might inhibit MRPs, such as O(+), SO(+), and NO(+) chemical
      species, although secondary fractionation will be required to conclusively
      identify the most potent inhibitors. Naphthenic acids (O2(-)), which were
      dominant in the acidic fraction, did not appear to be the cause of the
      inhibition. This is the first study to demonstrate that chemicals in the water
      soluble organic fraction of OSPW inhibit activity of this important class of
      proteins. However, aging of OSPW attenuates this effect and inhibition of the
      activity of MRPs by OSPW from Base Mine Lake does not occur at environmentally
      relevantconcentrations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tumor characteristics affect surgical complexity and outcomes of
      partial nephrectomy (PN). OBJECTIVE: To develop an Arterial Based Complexity
      (ABC) scoring system to predict morbidity of PN. DESIGN, SETTING, AND
      PARTICIPANTS: Four readers independently scored contrast-enhanced computed
      tomography images of 179 patients who underwent PN. INTERVENTION: Renal cortical 
      masses were categorized by the order of vessels needed to be transected/dissected
      during PN. Scores of 1, 2, 3S, or 3H were assigned to tumors requiring
      transection of interlobular and arcuate arteries, interlobar arteries, segmental 
      arteries, or in close proximity of the renal hilum, respectively during PN.
      OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Interobserver variability was
      assessed with kappa values and percentage of exact matches between each pairwise 
      combination of readers. Linear regression was used to evaluate the association
      between reference scores and ischemia time, estimated blood loss, and estimated
      glomerular filtration rates at 6 wk and 6 mo after surgery adjusted for baseline 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate. Fisher's exact test was used to test for
      differences in risk of urinary fistula formation by reference category
      assignment. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Pairwise comparisons of readers' score
      assignments were significantly correlated (all p<0.0001); average kappa = 0.545
      across all reader pairs. The average proportion of exact matches was 69%. Linear 
      regression between the complexity score system and surgical outcomes showed
      significant associations between reference category assignments and ischemia time
      (p<0.0001) and estimated blood loss (p=0.049). Fisher's exact test showed a
      significant difference in risk of urinary fistula formation with higher reference
      category assignments (p=0.028). Limitations include use of a single institutional
      cohort to evaluate our system. CONCLUSIONS: The ABC scoring system for PN is
      intuitive, easy to use, and demonstrated good correlation with perioperative
      morbidity. PATIENT SUMMARY: The ABC scoring system is a novel
      anatomy-reproducible tool developed to help patients and doctors understand the
      complexity of renal masses and predict the outcomes of kidney surgery.

TI  - ABC transporter PEN3/PDR8/ABCG36 interacts with calmodulin that, like PEN3, is
      required for Arabidopsis nonhost resistance.
PG  - 294-306
LID - 10.1111/nph.13582 [doi]
AB  - Nonhost resistance (NHR) is the most prevalent form of plant immunity. In
      Arabidopsis, NHR requires membrane-localized ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
      transporter PENETRATION (PEN) 3. Upon perception of pathogen-associated molecular
      patterns, PEN3 becomes phosphorylated, suggestive of PEN3 regulation by
      post-translational modification. Here, we investigated the PEN3 protein
      interaction network. We probed the Arabidopsis protein microarray AtPMA-5000 with
      the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PEN3. Several of the proteins identified to 
      interact with PEN3 in vitro represent cellular Ca(2+) sensors, including
      calmodulin (CaM) 3, CaM7 and several CaM-like proteins, pointing to the
      importance of Ca(2+) sensing to PEN3-mediated NHR. We demonstrated
      co-localization of PEN3 and CaM7, and we confirmed PEN3-CaM interaction in vitro 
      and in vivo by PEN3 pull-down with CaM Sepharose, CaM overlay assay and
      bimolecular fluorescence complementation. We also show that just like in pen3,
      NHR to the nonadapted fungal pathogens Phakopsora pachyrhizi and Blumeria
      graminis f.sp. hordei is compromised in the Arabidopsis cam7 and pen3 cam7
      mutants. Our study discloses CaM7 as a PEN3-interacting protein crucial to
      Arabidopsis NHR and emphasizes the importance of Ca(2+) sensing to plant
      immunity.

TI  - Arbuscular mycorrhiza affects nickel translocation and expression of ABC
      transporter and metallothionein genes in Festuca arundinacea.
PG  - 67-76
LID - 10.1007/s00572-015-0647-2 [doi]
AB  - Mycorrhizal fungi are key microorganisms for enhancing phytoremediation of soils 
      contaminated with heavy metals. In this study, the effects of the arbuscular
      mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) Funneliformis mosseae (=Glomus mosseae) on physiological
      and molecular mechanisms involved in the nickel (Ni) tolerance of tall fescue
      (Festuca arundinacea = Schedonorus arundinaceus) were investigated. Nickel
      addition had a pronounced negative effect on tall fescue growth and
      photosynthetic pigment contents, as well as on AMF colonization. Phosphorus
      content increased markedly in mycorrhizal plants (M) compared to non-inoculated
      (NM) ones. However, no significant difference was observed in root carbohydrate
      content between AMF-inoculated and non-inoculated plants. For both M and NM
      plants, Ni concentrations in shoots and roots increased according to the addition
      of the metal into soil, but inoculation with F. mosseae led to significantly
      lower Ni translocation from roots to the aboveground parts compared to
      non-inoculated plants. ABC transporter and metallothionein transcripts
      accumulated to considerably higher levels in tall fescue plants colonized by F.
      mosseae than in the corresponding non-mycorrhizal plants. These results highlight
      the importance of mycorrhizal colonization in alleviating Ni-induced stress by
      reducing Ni transport from roots to shoots of tall fescue plants.

TI  - The metabolic network of Clostridium acetobutylicum: Comparison of the
      approximate Bayesian computation via sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) and profile
      likelihood estimation (PLE) methods for determinability analysis.
PG  - 62-79
LID - 10.1016/j.mbs.2015.10.016 [doi]
LID - S0025-5564(15)00222-9 [pii]
AB  - The Gram-positive bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum is an anaerobic
      endospore-forming species which produces acetone, butanol and ethanol via the
      acetone-butanol (AB) fermentation process, leading to biofuels including butanol.
      In previous work we looked to estimate the parameters in an ordinary differential
      equation model of the glucose metabolism network using data from pH-controlled
      continuous culture experiments. Here we combine two approaches, namely the
      approximate Bayesian computation via an existing sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC)
      method (to compute credible intervals for the parameters), and the profile
      likelihood estimation (PLE) (to improve the calculation of confidence intervals
      for the same parameters), the parameters in both cases being derived from
      experimental data from forward shift experiments. We also apply the ABC-SMC
      method to investigate which of the models introduced previously (one
      non-sporulation and four sporulation models) have the greatest strength of
      evidence. We find that the joint approximate posterior distribution of the
      parameters determines the same parameters as previously, including all of the
      basal and increased enzyme production rates and enzyme reaction activity
      parameters, as well as the Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters for glucose
      ingestion, while other parameters are not as well-determined, particularly those 
      connected with the internal metabolites acetyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA and
      butyryl-CoA. We also find that the approximate posterior is strongly
      non-Gaussian, indicating that our previous assumption of elliptical contours of
      the distribution is not valid, which has the effect of reducing the numbers of
      pairs of parameters that are (linearly) correlated with each other. Calculations 
      of confidence intervals using the PLE method back this up. Finally, we find that 
      all five of our models are equally likely, given the data available at present.

TI  - miR-106b~25 cluster regulates multidrug resistance in an ABC
      transporter-independent manner via downregulation of EP300.
PG  - 1170-8
LID - 10.3892/or.2015.4412 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNA (miR)-106b~25 cluster regulates bypass of doxorubicin and
      gamma-radiation induced senescence by downregulation of the E-cadherin
      transcriptional activator EP300. We asked whether upregulation of miR-106~25
      cluster generates cells with a truly multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype and
      whether this is due to upregulation of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter
      P-glycoprotein. We used minimally transformed mammary epithelial breast cancer
      cells (MTMECs) in which the miR-106b~25 cluster was experimentally upregulated by
      lentiviral transfection or in which hairpins targeting either EP300 or E-cadherin
      mRNAs have been expressed with lentiviruses. We find that overexpression of
      miR-106b~25 cluster led to the generation of MDR MTMECs (resistant to etoposide, 
      colchicine and paclitaxel). Paclitaxel resistance was also studied after
      experimental downregulation of EP300 or E-cadherin. However none of these cells
      overexpressed P-glycoprotein or where able to efflux a fluorescent derivative of 
      paclitaxel, making this phenotype drug-transporter independent. Paclitaxel
      treatment in MTMECs led to an increase in early apoptotic cells (Annexin
      V-positive), activation of caspase-9 and increase in the proportion of cells at
      the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. However, MTMEC overexpressing miR-106b~25
      cluster, or with EP300 or E-cadherin downregulated, showed less activation of
      apoptosis, caspase-9 and caspase-3/-7 activities. Thus, miR-106b~25 cluster
      controls transporter-independent MDR by apoptosis evasion via downregulation of
      EP300.

TI  - Adherence to Oral Therapy for Urgency Urinary Incontinence: Results from the
      Anticholinergic Versus Botox Comparison (ABC) Trial.
PG  - 24-8
LID - 10.1097/SPV.0000000000000215 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Medication adherence with urgency urinary incontinence (UUI)
      treatment is challenging and the best assessment methodology is uncertain. We
      sought to describe adherence with anticholinergic (AC) versus placebo (P) by
      comparing pill counts and MEMSCAP event data and to identify factors associated
      with adherence. METHODS: The randomized controlled AC versus Botox Comparison
      trial of women with moderate to severe idiopathic UUI included 126 participants
      initiating AC plus P bladder injection and 121 receiving P pills plus Botox
      injection. Adherence data on 243 participants (124 AC and 119 P) were calculated 
      by pill count and MEMSCAP data for each 2-month interval during the 6-month study
      that allowed for dose escalation/drug change. Overall composite adherence
      estimates were calculated using the average of both methods and weighted by the
      duration of each 2-month interval. RESULTS: Treatment groups had no significant
      differences in dosing duration (P = 0.76) or mean adherence (AC, 83.3% [16.8] vs 
      P, 84.8% [13.8]). Only 53% of women met the dichotomous outcome of more than 80% 
      adherence during all intervals. Correlation between adherence by pill counts
      versus MEMSCAP decreased over time with pill counts demonstrating higher
      adherence than MEMSCAP (r = 0.53, 0.50, and 0.36 for each 2-month interval).
      Lower adherence was associated with higher baseline incontinence severity and
      better UUI quality of life for the AC group and with current smoking status in
      both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence using pill counts and MEMSCAP was reasonably 
      correlated and similar in both the AC and P groups. In the AC group, higher
      baseline incontinence severity and better UUI Quality of Life were associated
      with decreased adherence. Smokers were less adherent.

TI  - Rhinoviruses and Respiratory Enteroviruses: Not as Simple as ABC.
LID - 10.3390/v8010016 [doi]
LID - E16 [pii]
AB  - Rhinoviruses (RVs) and respiratory enteroviruses (EVs) are leading causes of
      upper respiratory tract infections and among the most frequent infectious agents 
      in humans worldwide. Both are classified in the Enterovirus genus within the
      Picornaviridae family and they have been assigned to seven distinct species,
      RV-A, B, C and EV-A, B, C, D. As viral infections of public health significance, 
      they represent an important financial burden on health systems worldwide.
      However, the lack of efficient antiviral treatment or vaccines against these
      highly prevalent pathogens prevents an effective management of RV-related
      diseases. Current advances in molecular diagnostic techniques have revealed the
      presence of RV in the lower respiratory tract and its role in lower airway
      diseases is increasingly reported. In addition to an established etiological role
      in the common cold, these viruses demonstrate an unexpected capacity to spread to
      other body sites under certain conditions. Some of these viruses have received
      particular attention recently, such as EV-D68 that caused a large outbreak of
      respiratory illness in 2014, respiratory EVs from species C, or viruses within
      the newly-discovered RV-C species. This review provides an update of the latest
      findings on clinical and fundamental aspects of RV and respiratory EV, including 
      a summary of basic knowledge of their biology.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess whether the 16-item Activities-specific Balance Confidence 
      scale (ABC-16) and short-form 6-item Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale
      (ABC-6) could predict future recurrent falls in people with Parkinson disease
      (PD) and to validate the robustness of their predictive capacities. DESIGN:
      Twelve-month prospective cohort study. SETTING: General community. PARTICIPANTS: 
      People with idiopathic PD (N=79). INTERVENTIONS: Clinical tests were conducted to
      assess symptom severity, balance confidence, and medical history. Over the
      subsequent 12 months, participants recorded any falls on daily fall calendars,
      which they returned monthly by reply paid post. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Logistic
      regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses estimated the
      sensitivities and specificities of the ABC-16 and ABC-6 for predicting future
      recurrent falls in this cohort, and "leave-one-out" validation was used to assess
      their robustness. RESULTS: Of the 79 patients who completed follow-up, 28 (35.4%)
      fell more than once during the 12-month period. Both the ABC-16 and ABC-6 were
      significant predictors of future recurrent falls, and moderate sensitivities
      (ABC-16: 75.0%; ABC-6: 71.4%) and specificities (ABC-16: 76.5%; ABC-6: 74.5%)
      were reported for each tool for a cutoff score of 77.5 and 65.8, respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: The results have significant implications and demonstrate that the
      ABC-16 and ABC-6 independently identify patients with PD at risk of future
      recurrent falls.

TI  - Prognostic factors for progression-free and overall survival in advanced biliary 
      tract cancer.
PG  - 134-40
LID - 10.1093/annonc/mdv483 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biliary tract cancer is an uncommon cancer with a poor outcome. We
      assembled data from the National Cancer Research Institute (UK) ABC-02 study and 
      10 international studies to determine prognostic outcome characteristics for
      patients with advanced disease. METHODS: Multivariable analyses of the final
      dataset from the ABC-02 study were carried out. All variables were simultaneously
      included in a Cox proportional hazards model, and backward elimination was used
      to produce the final model (using a significance level of 10%), in which the
      selected variables were associated independently with outcome. This score was
      validated externally by receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis using the
      independent international dataset. RESULTS: A total of 410 patients were included
      from the ABC-02 study and 753 from the international dataset. An overall survival
      (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) Cox model was derived from the ABC-02
      study. White blood cells, haemoglobin, disease status, bilirubin, neutrophils,
      gender, and performance status were considered prognostic for survival (all with 
      P < 0.10). Patients with metastatic disease {hazard ratio (HR) 1.56 [95%
      confidence interval (CI) 1.20-2.02]} and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
      performance status (ECOG PS) 2 had worse survival [HR 2.24 (95% CI 1.53-3.28)].
      In a dataset restricted to patients who received cisplatin and gemcitabine with
      ECOG PS 0 and 1, only haemoglobin, disease status, bilirubin, and neutrophils
      were associated with PFS and OS. ROC analysis suggested the models generated from
      the ABC-02 study had a limited prognostic value [6-month PFS: area under the
      curve (AUC) 62% (95% CI 57-68); 1-year OS: AUC 64% (95% CI 58-69)]. CONCLUSION:
      These data propose a set of prognostic criteria for outcome in advanced biliary
      tract cancer derived from the ABC-02 study that are validated in an international
      dataset. Although these findings establish the benchmark for the prognostic
      evaluation of patients with ABC and confirm the value of longheld clinical
      observations, the ability of the model to correctly predict prognosis is limited 
      and needs to be improved through identification of additional clinical and
      molecular markers.

TI  - Inhibitory effects of Antibiofilm compound 1 in Staphylococcus aureus biofilms.
LID - 10.1111/1348-0421.12359 [doi]
AB  - A novel benzamidazole molecule, identified in a small-molecule screen, known as
      antibiofilm compound 1 (ABC-1) was found to prevent bacterial biofilm formation
      in multiple bacterial pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus without
      affecting the growth of bacteria. Here, we tested biofilm inhibiting ability of
      156 microM ABC-1 in various biofilm forming strains of S. aureus. We demonstrated
      ABC-1 inhibits biofilm formation in these strains at micromolar concentrations
      regardless of the strains' dependence on Polysaccharide Intercellular Adhesin
      (PIA), cell wall-associated protein dependent or cell wall- associated
      extracellular DNA (eDNA). To our note, ABC-1 treatment primarily inhibited
      Protein A (SpA) expression in all strains tested. spa gene disruption showed
      decreased biofilm formation but the mutants still produced more biofilm than
      ABC-1 treated strains implying that ABC-1 affects not only SpA but also factors
      other than SpA. Indeed, ABC-1 also attenuated the accumulation of PIA and eDNA on
      cell surface. Our results suggested that ABC-1 have pleotropic effects on several
      biofilm components and thus inhibits biofilm formation in S. aureus.

TI  - Raltegravir and Abacavir/Lamivudine in Japanese Treatment-Naive and
      Treatment-Experienced Patients with HIV Infection: a 48-Week Retrospective Pilot 
      Analysis.
PG  - 33-8
LID - 10.7883/yoken.JJID.2014.236 [doi]
AB  - Abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor
      used for treating human immunodeficiency viral (HIV) infections. Hypersensitivity
      reactions such as skin eruptions caused by ABC are well-known, but rarely occur
      in Asians. Raltegravir (RAL) is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor, that is
      now increasingly, used for treating HIV infections because it has few adverse
      effects. This retrospective analysis assessed the efficacy and safety of combined
      ABC/3TC and RAL in both treatment-naive and -experienced Japanese patients with
      HIV infections. In all 11 treatment-naive patients (100%), virological
      suppression to undetectable level was achieved. Liver transaminases, renal
      function, and serum lipid profiles showed no exacerbations up to 48 weeks of
      treatment. In 12 patients who were switched from previous regimens to ABC/3TC and
      RAL, HIV viral load was undetectable in 11 patients (91.6%), but remained
      detectable in 1 patient with poor adherence. Major reasons for switching regimens
      to ABC/3TC and RAL were hyperlipidemia and nausea. After switching, these adverse
      effects improved, and no new adverse effects were observed. Despite the small
      number of participants in this study, the results support the combination of
      ABC/3TC and RAL as a possible treatment choice in Japanese individuals with
      HIV-infection.

TI  - Subtype-specific addiction of the activated B-cell subset of diffuse large B-cell
      lymphoma to FOXP1.
LID - 201524677 [pii]
AB  - High expression of the forkhead box P1 (FOXP1) transcription factor distinguishes
      the aggressive activated B cell (ABC) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
      subtype from the better prognosis germinal center B-cell (GCB)-DLBCL subtype and 
      is highly correlated with poor outcomes. A genetic or functional role for FOXP1
      in lymphomagenesis, however, remains unknown. Here, we report that sustained
      FOXP1 expression is vital for ABC-DLBCL cell-line survival. Genome-wide analyses 
      revealed direct and indirect FOXP1 transcriptional enforcement of ABC-DLBCL
      hallmarks, including the classical NF-kappaB and MYD88 (myeloid differentiation
      primary response gene 88) pathways. FOXP1 promoted gene expression underlying
      transition of the GCB cell to the plasmablast-the transient B-cell stage targeted
      in ABC-DLBCL transformation-by antagonizing pathways distinctive of GCB-DLBCL,
      including that of the GCB "master regulator," BCL6 (B-cell lymphoma 6). Cell-line
      derived FOXP1 target genes that were highly correlated with FOXP1 expression in
      primary DLBCL accurately segregated the corresponding clinical subtypes of a
      large cohort of primary DLBCL isolates and identified conserved pathways
      associated with ABC-DLBCL pathology.

TI  - Structural Uncertainty of Markov Models for Advanced Breast Cancer: A Simulation 
      Study of Lapatinib.
LID - 0272989X15622643 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of structural uncertainty of Markov models in
      modeling cost-effectiveness for the treatment of advanced breast cancer (ABC).
      METHODS: Four common Markov models for ABC were identified and examined. Markov
      models 1 and 2 have 4 health states (stable-disease, responding-to-therapy,
      disease-progressing, and death), and Markov models 3 and 4 only have 3 health
      states (stable-disease, disease-progressing, and death). In models 1 and 3, the
      possibility of death can occur in any health state, while in models 2 and 4, the 
      chance of dying can only occur in the disease-progressing health state. A
      simulation was conducted to examine the impact of using different model
      structures on cost-effectiveness results in the context of a combination therapy 
      of lapatinib and capecitabine for the treatment of HER2-positive ABC. Model
      averaging with an assumption of equal weights in all 4 models was used to account
      for structural uncertainty. RESULTS: Markov model 3 yielded the lowest
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $303,909 per quality-adjusted life
      year (QALY), while Markov model 1 produced the highest ICER ($495,800/QALY). At a
      willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/QALY, the probabilities that the
      combination therapy is considered to be cost-effective for Markov models 1, 2, 3,
      and 4 were 14.5%, 14.1%, 21.6%, and 17.0%, respectively. When using model
      averaging to synthesize different model structures, the resulting ICER was
      $389,270/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that modeling ABC with different
      Markov model structures yielded a wide range of cost-effectiveness results,
      suggesting the need to investigate structural uncertainty in health economic
      evaluation. When applied in the context of HER2-positive ABC treatment, the
      combination therapy with lapatinib is not cost-effective, regardless of which
      model was used and whether uncertainties were accounted for.

TI  - A mix of S and DeltaS variants of STAT3 enable survival of activated B-cell-like 
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells in culture.
PG  - e184
LID - 10.1038/oncsis.2015.44 [doi]
AB  - Activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC DLBCL) is characterized 
      by increased expression and activator of signal transducer and activator of
      transcription 3 (STAT3). ABC DLBCL cells require STAT3 for growth in culture. In 
      ABC DLBCL cells, eosinophils and perhaps all cells, four variant STAT3 mRNAs
      (Salpha, DeltaSalpha, Sbeta and DeltaSbeta) are present as a result of two
      alternative splicing events, one that results in the inclusion of a 55-residue
      C-terminal transactivation domain (alpha) or a truncated C-terminal domain with 7
      unique residues (beta) and a second that includes (S) or excludes (DeltaS) the
      codon for Ser-701 in the linker between the SH2 and C-terminal domains. A
      substantial literature indicates that both alpha and beta variants are required
      for optimal STAT3 function, but nothing is known about functions of DeltaS
      variants. We used a knockdown/re-expression strategy to explore whether survival 
      of ABC DLBCL cells requires that the four variants be in an appropriate ratio. No
      single variant rescued survival as well as STAT3Salpha-C, Salpha with activating 
      mutations (A661C and N663C) in the SH2 domain. Better rescue was achieved when
      all four variants were re-expressed or Salpha and DeltaSalpha or Sbeta and
      DeltaSbeta were re-expressed in pairs. Rescue correlated with expression of
      STAT3-sensitive genes NFKBIA and NFKBIZ. We consider a variety of explanations
      why a mix of S and DeltaS variants of STAT3 should enable survival of ABC DLBCL
      cells.

AB  - The anticodon nuclease (ACNase) PrrC is silenced by a DNA
      restriction-modification (RM) protein and activated by a phage T4-encoded
      restriction inhibitor. The activation is driven by GTP hydrolysis while dTTP,
      which accumulates during the infection, stabilizes the active form. We show here,
      first, that the ABC-ATPase N-domains of PrrC can accommodate the two nucleotides 
      simultaneously. Second, mutating a sequence motif that distinguishes the N-domain
      of PrrC from typical ABC-ATPases implicates three residues in the specificity for
      dTTP. Third, failure to bind dTTP or its deprivation hastened the centrifugal
      sedimentation of PrrC, possibly due to exposed sticky PrrC surfaces. Fourth, dTTP
      inhibited the GTPase activity of PrrC, probably by preventing GDP from leaving.
      These observations, correlated with relevant traits of a related ACNase, further 
      suggest that PrrC utilizes GTP at canonical ABC-ATPase sites and binds dTTP to
      distinct sites exposed upon disruption of the ACNase-silencing interaction with
      the RM partner.

TI  - Behavioral outcomes in children exposed prenatally to lamotrigine, valproate, or 
      carbamazepine.
LID - S0892-0362(16)30001-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ntt.2016.01.001 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate adaptive behavior outcomes of children prenatally exposed
      to lamotrigine, valproate, or carbamazepine, and to determine if these outcomes
      were dose-dependent. METHODS: Data were collected from women enrolled in the
      North American Anti-epileptic Drug (AED) Pregnancy Registry who had taken
      lamotrigine, valproate, or carbamazepine monotherapies throughout pregnancy to
      suppress seizures. The adaptive behavior of 252 exposed children (including 104
      lamotrigine-exposed, 97 carbamazepine-exposed, and 51 valproate-exposed), ages 3-
      to 6-years-old, was measured using the Vineland-II Adaptive Behavior Scales,
      administered to each mother by telephone. Mean Adaptive Behavior Composite (ABC),
      domain standard scores for communication, daily living, socialization and motor
      skills, and adaptive levels were analyzed and correlated with first trimester
      drug dose. RESULTS: After adjusting for maternal age, education, folate use,
      cigarette and alcohol exposure, gestational age, and birth weight by propensity
      score analysis, the mean ABC score for valproate-exposed children was 95.6 (95%
      CI [91, 101]), versus 100.8 (95% CI [98, 103]) and 103.5 (95% CI [101, 106]) for 
      carbamazepine- and lamotrigine-exposed children, respectively (ANOVA; p=0.017).
      Significant differences were observed among the three drug groups in the ABC
      (p=0.017), socialization (p=0.026), and motor (p=0.018) domains, with a trend
      toward significance in the communication domain (p=0.053). Valproate-exposed
      children scored lowest and lamotrigine-exposed children scored highest in every
      category. Valproate-exposed children were most likely to perform at a low or
      moderately low adaptive level in each category. Higher valproate dose was
      associated with significantly lower ABC (p=0.020), socialization (p=0.009), and
      motor (p=0.041) scores before adjusting for confounders. After adjusting for the 
      above variables, increasing VPA dose was associated with decreasing Vineland
      scores in all domains, but the relationships were not statistically significant. 
      No dose effect was observed for carbamazepine or lamotrigine. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike
      carbamazepine and lamotrigine, prenatal valproate exposure was associated with
      adaptive behavior impairments with specific deficits in socialization and motor
      function, along with a relative weakness in communication. Increasing valproate
      dose was associated with a decline in adaptive functioning. This finding of a
      linear dose-dependent teratogenic effect suggests that valproate should be
      avoided at any dose during pregnancy. However, some women with epilepsy
      controlled only by valproate will decide, in consultation with their provider,
      that the benefits of continuing valproate during pregnancy outweigh the fetal
      risks. Faced with difficult choices, clinicians should be supportive as these
      patients consider their options.

TI  - Clinical improvement following vitamin D3 supplementation in Autism Spectrum
      Disorder.
AB  - Objective High prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was previously reported in
      children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), but little is known about the
      efficacy of vitamin D3 treatment in ASD, although data from pilot studies seem
      promising. We hypothesized that serum vitamin D levels are reduced in ASD and
      correlate with the severity of disease. Also, we hypothesized that vitamin D3
      treatment may be beneficial for a considerable portion of children with ASD.
      Methods In total, 215 children with ASD and 285 healthy control children were
      recruited in our study. Thirty seven of 215 ASD children received vitamin D3
      treatment. The Autism Behaviour Checklist (ABC) and the Childhood Autism Rating
      Scale (CARS) were used to assess autism symptoms. High-performance liquid
      chromatography was used to assess the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH) D] level.
      Evaluations of ABC, CARS, and serum 25(OH) D levels were performed before and
      after 3 months of treatment. Results Serum levels of 25(OH) D were significantly 
      lower in ASD children than typically developing children. Levels of serum 25(OH) 
      D were negatively correlated with ABC total scores and language subscale scores. 
      After vitamin D3 supplementation, symptom scores were significantly reduced on
      the CARS and ABC. In addition, the data also suggest that treatment effects were 
      more pronounced in younger children with ASD. Conclusion Vitamin D deficiency
      might contribute to the aetiology of ASD. Supplementation of vitamin D3, which is
      a safe and cost-effective form of treatment, may significantly improve the
      outcome of some children with ASD, especially younger children (identifier
      ChiCTR-CCC-13004498). Clinical Trial Registration The trial 'Association of

TI  - Catalytic Mechanism of the Maltose Transporter Hydrolyzing ATP.
PG  - 224-31
LID - 10.1021/acs.biochem.5b00970 [doi]
AB  - We use quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations to study
      ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by the maltose transporter. This protein is a
      prototypical member of a large family that consists of ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
      transporters. The ABC proteins catalyze ATP hydrolysis to perform a variety of
      biological functions. Despite extensive research efforts, the precise molecular
      mechanism of ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by the ABC enzymes remains elusive. In this
      work, the reaction pathway for ATP hydrolysis in the maltose transporter is
      evaluated using a QM/MM implementation of the nudged elastic band method without 
      presuming reaction coordinates. The potential of mean force along the reaction
      pathway is obtained with an activation free energy of 19.2 kcal/mol in agreement 
      with experiments. The results demonstrate that the reaction proceeds via a
      dissociative-like pathway with a trigonal bipyramidal transition state in which
      the cleavage of the gamma-phosphate P-O bond occurs and the O-H bond of the lytic
      water molecule is not yet broken. Our calculations clearly show that the Walker B
      glutamate as well as the switch histidine stabilizes the transition state via
      electrostatic interactions rather than serving as a catalytic base. The results
      are consistent with biochemical and structural experiments, providing novel
      insight into the molecular mechanism of ATP hydrolysis in the ABC proteins.

TI  - Relationship of physical distress to dizziness in patients with fibromyalgia.
PG  - 56-61
LID - 10.3109/00016489.2015.1088662 [doi]
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The feelings of dizziness and unsteadiness of the patients with
      fibromyalgia supposed specifically amplified by the hypersensitivity mechanism of
      CSS (central sensitivity syndrome) of them. The severity of subjective pain and
      physical distress according to the questionnaires were not correlated with the
      objective body sway on the stabilometer. OBJECTIVES: Fibromyalgia manifests
      primarily as chronic pain of the entire body, but is also often associated with a
      variety of physical symptoms including dizziness and unsteadiness. This study
      assessed whether objective measures of body sway and unsteadiness of them are
      associated with their subjective dizziness findings. METHOD: Subjects were 24
      patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia, but one patient who had the past history of
      sudden deafness was excluded. The 23 patients were assessed by a stabilometer as 
      the objective measures of body sway, and JFIQ (Japanese version of the
      fibromyalgia impact questionnaire), DHI (dizziness handicap inventory) and ABC
      (activities-specific balance confidence) as the subjective questionnaires.
      RESULTS: The significant correlations were shown between the scores of JFIQ and
      DHI, JFIQ and ABC, and DHI and ABC. Then, the body sway index of stabilometer
      environmental area was significantly correlated with DHI score. However, the
      stabilometer index was not correlated neither with JFIQ or ABC.

TI  - Progression of Liver Fibrosis and Modern Combination Antiretroviral Therapy
      Regimens in HIV-Hepatitis C-Coinfected Persons.
PG  - 242-9
LID - 10.1093/cid/civ838 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Liver diseases progress faster in human immunodeficiency virus
      (HIV)-hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected persons than HIV-monoinfected persons.
      The aim of this study was to compare rates of liver fibrosis progression
      (measured by the aspartate-to-platelet ratio index [APRI]) among
      HIV-HCV-coinfected users of modern protease inhibitor (PI)- and nonnucleoside
      reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimens with a backbone of
      tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) or abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC). METHODS: Data
      from a Canadian multicenter cohort study were analyzed, including 315 HCV
      polymerase chain reaction-positive persons who initiated antiretroviral therapy
      with a PI or NNRTI and a backbone containing either TDF/FTC or ABC/3TC.
      Multivariate linear regression analyses with generalized estimating equations
      were performed after propensity score matching to balance covariates across
      classes of anchor agent. RESULTS: A backbone of TDF/FTC was received by 67% of PI
      users and 69% of NNRTI users. Both PI and NNRTI use was associated with increases
      in APRI over time when paired with a backbone of ABC/3TC: 16% per 5 years (95%
      confidence interval [CI], 4%, 29%) and 11% per 5 years (95% CI, 2%, 20%),
      respectively. With TDF/FTC use, no clear association was found among PI users (8%
      per 5 years, 95% CI, -3%, 19%) or NNRTI users (3% per 5 years, 95% CI, -7%, 12%).
      CONCLUSIONS: Liver fibrosis progression was more influenced by the backbone than 
      by the class of anchor agent in HIV-HCV-coinfected persons. Only
      ABC/3TC-containing regimens were associated with an increase of APRI score over
      time, regardless of the class of anchor agent used.

TI  - De novo CD5+ Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma: Adverse outcomes with and without
      stem cell transplantation in a large, multi-center, rituximab treated cohort.
LID - 10.1002/ajh.24299 [doi]
AB  - De novo CD5+ diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) are a distinct subgroup of
      DLBCL with poor prognosis. However the role of rituximab-containing therapy and
      salvage stem cell transplantation in this patients' population remain to be
      defined. We retrospectively reviewed clinical features and outcomes of 102
      patients with de novo CD5+ DLBCL treated with rituximab-containing therapy at 9
      different institutions. By Hans' criteria, 64 patients had activated B-cell (ABC)
      subtype, 24 germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype, and 14 were not evaluated. No
      patients had a myc translocation. Eighty-three patients were treated with
      rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (R-CHOP), 7
      with rituximab, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone
      (R-EPOCH) and 6 with R-CHOP with methotrexate, 3 g/m2 . The overall response rate
      to frontline therapy was 85%. The 3-year progression free survival (PFS) and
      overall survival (OS) for all patients were 40% and 65%, respectively. The 3-year
      PFS for ABC- and GCB-subtypes was 34% and 45%, respectively. The 3-year OS for
      ABC- and GCB-subtypes was 62% and 67%, respectively. The median time to second
      treatment failure was 3 months and 1 month for ABC- and GCB-subtypes,
      respectively. Twenty of 28 (71%) transplanted patients with autologous,
      allogeneic, or both, relapsed. This study confirms the poor prognosis of de novo 
      CD5+ DLBCL in a large multi-center cohort despite initial rituximab-containing
      chemotherapy and suggests that stem cell transplantation fails to salvage the
      majority of these patients. Approaches to prevent recurrence and/or novel
      therapies for relapsed disease are needed for this subgroup of DLBCL patients.

TI  - Frequent MYD88 L265P and CD79B Mutations in Primary Breast Diffuse Large B-Cell
      Lymphoma.
AB  - Primary breast diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PB-DLBCL) is a rare disease
      comprising <3% of extranodal lymphomas. It frequently reveals an activated B-cell
      (ABC)-like phenotype. ABC-like DLBCL was reported to have gain-of-function
      mutations in MYD88, CD79B, CARD11, and TNFAIP3, resulting in constitutive
      activation of the NFkappaB pathway. Because of the rare occurrence of PB-DLBCL,
      the frequency of MYD88 and CD79B mutations is still unknown. We used Sanger
      sequencing to study these mutations from 46 breast DLBCL cases and also
      investigated the associated clinicopathologic factors. MYD88 L265P was confirmed 
      by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction and compared with the Sanger
      sequencing results. MYD88 L265P and CD79B mutations were detected in 27/46
      (58.7%) and 11/33 (33.3%) cases, respectively. Twenty-eight of 46 cases met the
      criteria for PB-DLBCL, and the latter 18 cases were further classified as
      clinical breast DLBCL (CLB-DLBCL). The frequency of MYD88 L265P and CD79B
      mutations was 16/28 (57.1%) and 9/23 (39.1%), respectively, in PB-DLBCL and 11/18
      (61.1%) and 2/10 (20%), respectively, in CLB-DLBCL. When the cutoff value was set
      at DeltaCt</=1, the result of allele-specific polymerase chain reaction for MYD88
      corresponded to those of the Sanger sequence at 92.6% sensitivity and 100%
      specificity. According to Choi's algorithm, 16/27 (59.3%) demonstrated an
      ABC-like phenotype in PB-DLBCL, and 15/18 (83.3%) demonstrated an ABC-like
      phenotype in CLB-DLBCL. In conclusion, MYD88 L265P and CD79B mutations were
      frequently detected in PB-DLBCL, and they may be key molecules associated with
      PB-DLBCL lymphomagenesis. Further analysis will be required to clarify the
      mechanism of its pathogenesis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Addressing subthreshold depression (indicated prevention) and
      vulnerabilities that increase the risk of major depression or anxiety disorders
      (selective prevention) is important for protecting mental health in old age. The 
      Depression-Agency Based Collaborative (Dep-ABC) is a prevention trial involving
      older adults recruited from aging services sites (home care agencies, senior
      housing, senior centers) who meet criteria for subthreshold depression and
      disability. Therefore, the authors examine the effectiveness of partnerships with
      aging services sites for recruiting at-risk older adults, the quality of
      recruitment and acceptability of the Dep-ABC assessment and intervention, and the
      baseline status of participants. METHODS: Dep-ABC is a single-blind randomized
      controlled prevention trial set in aging services settings but with centralized
      screening, randomization, in-home assessments, and follow-up. Its intervention
      arm involves six to eight sessions of problem-solving therapy, in which older
      adults aged 60+ learn to break down problems that affect well-being and develop
      strategies to address them. We examined participation rates to assess quality of 
      recruitment across sites and level of disability according to service use.
      RESULTS: Dep-ABC randomized 104 participants, 68.4% of eligible older adults.
      Screening using self-reported disability successfully netted a sample in which
      74% received home care agency services, with remaining participants similarly
      impaired in structured self-reports of impairment and on observed performance
      tests. CONCLUSION: Direct outreach to aging services providers is an effective
      way to identify older adults with service needs at high risk of major depression.
      Problem-solving therapy is acceptable to this population and can be added to
      current services.

TI  - Goal adjustment influence on psychological well-being following advanced breast
      cancer diagnosis.
PG  - 58-65

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A diagnosis of advanced breast cancer (ABC) challenges a woman's
      ambitions. This longitudinal study explored (1) if goal adjustment disposition
      influenced psychological adjustment patterns among women with ABC and (2) if
      dispositional hope and optimism moderate effects of goal adjustment on
      psychological adjustment. METHODS: One hundred ninety three out of 225 women with
      ABC were assessed while they were awaiting/receiving initial chemotherapy, then
      again at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-baseline. Goal
      disengagement, goal reengagement, optimism, hope, and psychological adjustment
      (anxiety, depression, and positive affect) were assessed at baseline;
      psychological adjustment was reassessed at each follow-up. Latent growth curve
      modeling was used to examine the change of psychological adjustment and test the 
      study objectives. RESULTS: High goal disengagement, low reengagement, and high
      optimism were associated with lower initial anxiety, while high goal
      disengagement and optimism predicted a slower rate of change in anxiety. High
      goal disengagement, reengagement, and optimism were associated with lower initial
      depression. High goal reengagement, optimism, and hope were associated with
      initial positive affect scores, while optimism predicted its rate of change.
      Optimism moderated the effect of goal disengagement on anxiety and depression,
      whereas hope moderated the effect of goal reengagement on positive affect.
      CONCLUSION: Goal disengagement and reengagement are two relatively independent
      processes influencing psychological well-being. These findings will help
      clinicians to tailor specific interventions to help women coping with the
      diagnosis of ABC. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Identification and functional characterization of Penicillium marneffei
      pleiotropic drug resistance transporters ABC1 and ABC2.
LID - myv117 [pii]
AB  - Penicilliosis caused by the dimorphic fungus Penicillium marneffei is an endemic,
      AIDS-defining illness and, after tuberculosis and cryptococcosis, the third most 
      common opportunistic infection of AIDS patients in tropical Southeast Asia.
      Untreated, patients have poor prognosis; however, primary amphotericin B
      treatment followed by prolonged itraconazole prophylaxis is effective. To
      identify ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters that may play a role in
      potential multidrug resistance of P. marneffei, we identified and classified all 
      46 P. marneffei ABC transporters from the genome sequence. PmABC1 and PmABC2 were
      most similar to the archetype Candida albicans multidrug efflux pump gene CDR1.
      P. marneffei Abc1p (PmAbc1p) was functionally expressed in Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae, although at rather low levels, and correctly localized to the plasma 
      membrane, causing cells to be fourfold to eightfold more resistant to azoles and 
      many other xenobiotics than untransformed cells. P. marneffei Abc2p (PmAbc2p) was
      expressed at similarly low levels, but it had no efflux activity and did not
      properly localize to the plasma membrane. Interestingly, PmAbc1p mislocalized and
      lost its transport activity when cells were shifted to 37 degrees C. We conclude 
      that expression of PmAbc1p in S. cerevisiae confers resistance to several
      xenobiotics indicating that PmAbc1p may be a multidrug efflux pump.

TI  - The lipid bilayer modulates the structure and function of an ATP-binding cassette
      exporter.
LID - jbc.M115.698498 [pii]
AB  - ATP-binding cassette (ABC) exporters use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to
      transport substrates across membranes by switching between inward- and
      outward-facing conformations. Essentially all structural studies of these
      proteins have been performed with the proteins in detergent micelles, locked in
      specific conformations and/or at low temperature. Here, we used luminescence
      resonance energy transfer (LRET) spectroscopy to study the prototypical ABC
      exporter MsbA reconstituted in nanodiscs,at 37 degrees C, and while it performs
      ATP hydrolysis. We found major differences when comparing MsbA in these
      native-like conditions with double electron-electron resonance data and the
      crystal structure of MsbA in the open inward-facing conformation. The most
      striking differences include a significantly smaller separation between the
      nucleotide-binding domains and a larger fraction of molecules with associated
      nucleotide-binding domains in the nucleotide-free apo state. These studies stress
      the importance of studying membrane proteins in an environment that approaches
      physiological conditions.

AB  - An enhanced expression of genes encoding ATP binding cassette (ABC) and major
      facilitator superfamily (MFS) transport proteins are known to contribute to the
      development of tolerance to antifungals in pathogenic yeasts. For example, the
      azole resistant (AR) clinical isolates of the opportunistic human fungal pathogen
      Candida albicans show an overexpression of CDR1 and/or CaMDR1 belonging to ABC
      and MFS, superfamilies, respectively. The reduced accumulation (due to rapid
      efflux) of drugs in AR isolates confirms the role of efflux pump proteins in the 
      development of drug tolerance. Considering the importance of major multidrug
      transporters, the focus of recent research has been to understand the structure
      and function of these proteins which could help to design inhibitors/modulators
      of these pump proteins. This chapter focuses on some aspects of the structure and
      function of yeast transporter proteins particularly in relation to MDR in
      Candida.

TI  - The role of glucuronidation in drug resistance.
LID - S0163-7258(16)00010-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2016.01.009 [doi]
AB  - The final therapeutic effect of a drug candidate, which is directed to a specific
      molecular target strongly depends on its absorption, distribution, metabolism and
      excretion (ADME). The disruption of at least one element of ADME may result in
      serious drug resistance. In this work we described the role of one element of
      this resistance: phase II metabolism with UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs).
      UGT function is the transformation of their substrates into more polar
      metabolites, which are better substrates for the ABC transporters, MDR1, MRP and 
      BCRP, than the native drug. UGT-mediated drug resistance can be associated with
      (i) inherent overexpression of the enzyme, named intrinsic drug resistance or
      (ii) induced expression of the enzyme, named acquired drug resistance observed
      when enzyme expression is induced by the drug or other factors, as food-derived
      compounds. Very often this induction occurs via ligand binding receptors
      including AhR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor) PXR (pregnane X receptor), or other
      transcription factors. The effect of UGT dependent resistance is strengthen by
      coordinate action and also a coordinate regulation of the expression of UGTs and 
      ABC transporters. This coupling of UGT and multidrug resistance proteins has been
      intensively studied, particularly in the case of antitumor treatment, when this
      resistance is "improved" by differences in UGT expression between tumor and
      healthy tissue. Multidrug resistance coordinated with glucuronidation has also
      been described here for drugs used in the management of epilepsy, psychiatric
      diseases, HIV infections, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Proposals to
      reverse UGT-mediated drug resistance should consider the endogenous functions of 
      UGT.

AB  - Multicolor flow cytometer assays with fluorescently labeled antibodies are
      routinely used in clinical laboratories to measure the cell number of specific
      immunophenotypes and to estimate expression levels of specific receptors/antigens
      either on the cell surface or intracellularly. The cell number and specific
      receptors/antigens serve as biomarkers for pathological conditions at various
      stages of a disease. Existing methods and cell reference materials for
      quantitative expression measurements have not yet produced results that are of
      wide clinical interest or are instrument-independent across all fluorescence
      channels. This unit details a procedure for quantifying surface and intracellular
      biomarkers by calibrating the output of a multicolor flow cytometer in units of
      antibody bound per cell (ABC). The procedure includes (1) quality control of the 
      flow cytometer, (2) fluorescence intensity calibration using hard dyed
      microspheres assigned with fluorescence intensity values, (3) compensation for
      fluorescence spillover between adjacent fluorescence channels, and (4)
      application of a biological reference calibrator to establish an ABC scale. The
      unit also points out current efforts for quantifying biomarkers in a manner that 
      is independent of instrument platforms and reagent differences. (c) 2016 by John

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple-drug therapy for tuberculosis (TB) and TB-associated
      co-morbidity increase the likelihood of drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Inhibition
      of membrane transporters is an important mechanism underlying DDIs. In this
      study, we assessed the in vitro inhibitory potential of currently used first and 
      second-line TB drugs and of proposed mycobacterial efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) 
      on the major ABC transporters relevant to drug transport, namely P-gp, BCRP, BSEP
      and MRP1-5. METHODS: Membrane vesicles isolated from transporter-overexpressing
      HEK293 cells were used to study the inhibitory action of TB drugs and EPIs on the
      transport of model substrates [(3)H]-NMQ (P-gp); [(3)H]-E1S (BCRP); [(3)H]-TCA
      (BSEP); [(3)H]-E217betaG (MRP1, 3 and 4) and [(3)H]-MTX (MRP2 and 5). RESULTS: A 
      strong inhibition (IC50 value <15 muM) was observed for clofazimine (P-gp, BCRP
      and MRP1), thioridazine (BCRP), timcodar (P-gp, BSEP and MRP1) and SQ109 (P-gp
      and BCRP). Rifampicin inhibited all transporters, but less potently. CONCLUSIONS:
      Co-administration of clofazimine, thioridazine, timcodar, SQ109 and possibly
      rifampicin with drugs that are substrates for the inhibited transporters may lead
      to DDIs. The mycobacterial EPIs potently inhibited a wider range of human ABC
      transporters than previously reported. These vesicular transport data are
      especially valuable considering the current emphasis on development of TB drug
      regimens.

TI  - Selective arterial Embolisation of Aneurysmal Bone Cysts of the Sacrum: a
      promising Alternative to Surgery.
PG  - 53-59
AB  - Purpose: The sacrum is a rare but unfavourable location for Aneurysmal Bone Cysts
      (ABCs), surgical procedures aiming to achieve local tumour control can be
      mutilating. Aim of this study was to evaluate whether selective arterial
      embolisation (AE) of ABC of the sacrum is an effective treatment and might be an 
      alternative to surgical treatment options. Materials and Methods: Between 2007
      and 2011 six patients (mean age 13.7 years, range 8 - 18 years) with an ABC of
      the sacrum were treated by AE. Follow-up was performed by MRI-scans as well as
      clinical examination (mean 36.5 months, range 14 - 56 months). Results: No
      treatment related complications have been observed. AE resulted in
      devascularisation of ABC and led to local tumour control in all patients. A
      partial consolidation was noticed in three patients. Pain relief was achieved in 
      five of six patients, neurological deficits dissolved. In two patients more than 
      one embolization was necessary. In one of these patients due to exacerbation of
      pain a surgical decompression was performed. Conclusion: AE of sacral ABCs can
      serve as an effective and safe treatment option. Thus it might be an alternative 
      to potentially harmful surgical procedures. In case of ongoing tumour growth or
      pain recurrence AE can be repeated. In case of treatment failure surgical
      interventions are still possible. Key Points: * transarterial embolisation
      enables local tumour control in sacral ABCs* transarterial embolisation of sacral
      ABCs is a safe procedure* in case of tumour progression repetitive embolisations 
      are possible and effective Citation Format: * Henrichs MP, Beck L, Gosheger G et

TI  - IPEC-J2 MDR1, a Novel High-Resistance Cell Line with Functional Expression of
      Human P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) for Drug Screening Studies.
AB  - The P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump has been shown to affect drug distribution 
      and absorption in various organs and to cause drug resistance in cancer therapy. 
      The aim of this work was to develop a cell line to serve as a screening system
      for potential substrates of P-gp. This requires a cell line with high
      paracellular tightness, low expression of nonhuman ABC transporters, and high
      expression of functional human P-gp (ABCB1). The porcine intestinal epithelial
      cell line, IPEC-J2, was selected as a transfection host, due to its ability to
      form extremely high-resistance monolayers (>10000 Omega.cm2) and its low
      endogenous expression of ABC-type efflux transporters. The IPEC-J2 cells were
      transfected with a plasmid that contained the sequence of the human MDR1 gene,
      which encodes P-gp, followed by a selection of successfully transfected cells
      with geneticin and puromycin. The resulting cell line, IPEC-J2 MDR1, retained its
      high transepithelilal resistance (>15000 Omega.cm2), which translated into low
      permeability of the small hydrophilic tracer, mannitol (P < 10-7 cm.s-1). The
      lipophilic compound, diazepam, displayed high permeability resulting in a dynamic
      range of 1500 (PDiazepam/Pmannitol) to separate high and low permeability
      compounds. Human P-gp was expressed predominantly in the apical membrane, as
      demonstrated by immunocytochemistry, Western blots, and a high efflux ratios
      (Pbasolateral-apical/Papical-basolateral) of known P-gp substrates. P-gp was
      demonstrated to be responsible for the efflux transport by substrate profiling,
      combined with application of P-gp and BCRP inhibitors. Furthermore, the compounds
      atenolol, citalopram, and mitoxantrone were identified as P-gp substrates.
      Functional P-gp expression was shown to be stable through at least 10 cell
      passages. In conclusion, the IPEC-J2 MDR1 cell line displays high paracellular
      tightness combined with high expression of human P-gp and low expression of
      porcine ABC transporters, and it may serve as a useful tool in drug development
      studies.

TI  - The Relationship Between Balance Confidence and Cognitive Motor Interference in
      Individuals With Multiple Sclerosis.
PG  - 66-71
AB  - Gait and cognitive impairments are compounded when performed simultaneously in
      individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), and this is termed cognitive-motor
      interference (CMI). The authors examined whether CMI is related to balance
      confidence in individuals with MS. They hypothesized that individuals with low
      balance confidence would exhibit greater CMI possibly indicating a behavioral
      modification during dual task conditions. Thirty-four individuals with MS
      completed Activity-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale and a cognitive
      assessment as well as single and dual task walking trials at a comfortable pace. 
      CMI was calculated as the percent change in walking velocity and cognitive task
      performance from single- to dual-task conditions and termed dual-task cost (DTC).
      A correlation analysis was performed to determine the relationships between DTCs 
      of gait and cognitive performance and ABC scores. The correlation analysis
      revealed no significant association between ABC and DTC of walking velocity (p > 
      .05). A significant relationship between balance confidence and DTCs of cognition
      was observed. The observed relationships suggest individuals with MS tend to
      alter their cognitive performance rather than manipulating their gait when
      confronted with a dual task. Overall, the findings partially support a behavioral
      explanation of CMI in individuals with MS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Risperidone is a common psychopharmacological treatment for
      irritability in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It is not well-established how
      effective risperidone is across the initial symptom severity range. This study
      aims to examine the influence of baseline severity on the efficacy of risperidone
      in the treatment of ASD. METHODS: Participants were from the NIMH funded RUPP
      multisite, randomized, double-blind trial that compared risperidone to placebo to
      treat autistic disorder with severe tantrums, aggression, or self-injury.
      Participants were aged 5 to 17, and randomly assigned to risperidone (n=49) or
      placebo (n=52). Baseline and change scores were computed with the Aberrant
      Behavior Checklist (ABC) parent assessed scales with irritability as the primary 
      outcome, as well as the clinician assessed ABC Irritability subscale, and
      Clinical Global Impression Scale. RESULTS: The relationship between baseline
      severity and change scores for the risperdone and placebo groups was examined
      with eight competing three-level mixed-effects models for repeated measure
      models. Significant (P<0.01) interactions between treatment and baseline severity
      were observed for parent ABC ratings of irritability and lethargy only. Greater
      magnitudes of the differences between risperidone and placebo were observed from 
      moderate to very severe baseline severity on irritability and lethargy. Initial
      severity values over approximately 30 had a strong effect on symptom change
      [irritability: effect size (ES)=1.9, number needed to treat (NNT)=2, lethargy
      ES=0.9, NNT=5]. CONCLUSIONS: Parents may expect benefits of risperidone on
      irritability and lethargy with moderate to severe symptoms of ASD. TRIAL

AB  - Genistein has been shown to enhance the antitumor activity of trichostatin A
      (TSA) in human lung carcinoma A549 cells. However, whether the combined treatment
      exerts the same effect in other lung cancer cells is unclear. In the present
      study we first compared the enhancing effect of genistein on the antitumor effect
      of TSA in ABC-1, NCI-H460 (H460) and A549 cells. Second, we investigated whether 
      the effects of genistein are associated with increased histone/non-histone
      protein acetylation. We found that the enhancing effect of genistein on
      cell-growth-arrest in ABC-1 cells (p53 mutant) was less than in A549 and H460
      cells. Genistein enhanced TSA induced apoptosis in A549 and H460 cells rather
      than in ABC-1 cells. After silencing p53 expression in A549 and H460 cells, the
      enhancing effect of genistein was diminished. In addition, genistein increased
      TSA-induced histone H3/H4 acetylation in A549 and H460 cells. Genistein also
      increased p53 acetylation in H460 cells. The inhibitor of acetyltransferase,
      anacardic acid, diminished the enhancing effect of genistein on all TSA-induced
      histone/p53 acetylation and apoptosis. Genistein in combination with TSA
      increased the expression of p300 protein, an acetyltransferase, in A549 and
      NCI-H460 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that genistein also enhanced the
      antitumor effect of genistein in A549-tumor-bearing mice. Taken together, these
      results suggest that the enhancing effects of genistein on TSA-induced apoptosis 
      in lung cancer cells were p53-dependent and were associated with
      histone/non-histone protein acetylation.

TI  - Falls, Balance Confidence, and Lower-Body Strength in Patients Seeking Outpatient
      Venous Ulcer Wound Care.
PG  - 85-93

AB  - PURPOSE & ABSTRACT: To provide information about a quality improvement project
      examining falls in persons seeking outpatient wound care. TARGET AUDIENCE: This
      continuing education activity is intended for physicians and nurses with an
      interest in skin and wound care. OBJECTIVES: After participating in this
      educational activity, the participant should be better able to:1. Describe the
      scope of the problem and the related quality improvement project. 2. Delineate
      the results of the project and their implications for treatment of patients with 
      venous ulcers. OBJECTIVE: The authors aim to examine fall occurrence and fall
      injuries in persons seeking outpatient wound care and to compare falls, balance
      confidence, and lower-body strength in persons with injection-related venous
      ulcers (IRVUs) versus persons with venous ulcers (VUs) related to other risk
      factors besides injection drugs (VUs-other). DESIGN: This quality improvement
      project used a cross-sectional, comparative design. Participants responded to
      demographic questions, the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale,
      fear of falling, fall numbers, and injuries and performed the 30-second
      chair-rise test. SETTING: Outpatient wound service. PATIENTS: Patients (N = 106; 
      mean age, 59.94 years) included men (66%) and women. RESULTS: Sixty patients
      reported falling; 47 were recurrent fallers. Twenty patients stated they were
      injured, but did not go to an emergency department. A higher number of total
      falls was significantly related to more comorbidities. Total falls were
      significantly related to fear of falling and ABC Scale scores. Those with
      VUs-other had significantly more comorbidities and higher body mass index values 
      than those with IRVUs. Those with IRVUs were comparable to those VUs-other on
      number of falls and fear of falling, respectively. Those with IRVUs (7.30)
      performed significantly more chair rises than those with VUs-other (4.72).
      Persons with IRVUs had significantly higher ABC Scale scores (63.24%) than those 
      with VUs-other (49.38%). CONCLUSIONS: Falls are a common occurrence in persons
      seeking outpatient wound care. Despite greater strength sufficient to perform
      more chair rises among those with IRVUs, fall rates were comparable to those of
      weaker individuals with other types of VUs. With the high occurrence of falls
      during the project, long-term risk for fall injury would be high. Further
      research is needed to clarify interactions between VU risk and patient factors
      such as strength, age, agility, and impaired cognition.

TI  - Using the BacMam Baculovirus System to Study Expression and Function of
      Recombinant Efflux Drug Transporters in Polarized Epithelial Cell Monolayers.
PG  - 180-8
LID - 10.1124/dmd.115.066506 [doi]
AB  - The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily includes several
      membrane-bound proteins that are critical to drug pharmacokinetics and
      disposition. Pharmacologic evaluation of these proteins in vitro remains a
      challenge. In this study, human ABC transporters were expressed in polarized
      epithelial cell monolayers transduced using the BacMam baculovirus gene transfer 
      system. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of BacMam
      baculovirus to transduce cells grown in monolayers. In a porcine kidney cell
      line, LLC-PK1 cells, baculoviral transduction is successful only via the apical
      side of a polarized monolayer. We observed that recombinant ABC transporters were
      expressed on the cell surface with post-translational modification. Furthermore, 
      sodium butyrate played a critical role in recombinant protein expression, and
      preincubation in the presence of tunicamycin or thapsigargin enhanced protein
      expression. Cells overexpressing human P-glycoprotein (P-gp) showed vectorial
      basolateral-to-apical transport of [(3)H]-paclitaxel, which could be reversed by 
      the inhibitor tariquidar. Similarly, coexpression of human P-gp and ABCG2 in
      LLC-PK1 cells resulted in higher transport of mitoxantrone, which is a substrate 
      for both transporters, than in either P-gp- or ABCG2-expressing cells alone.
      Taken together, our results indicate that a high level of expression of efflux
      transporters in a polarized cell monolayer is technically feasible with the
      BacMam baculovirus system.

TI  - Yeast Transcriptome and In Vivo Hypoxia Detection Reveals Histoplasma capsulatum 
      Response to Low Oxygen Tension.
PG  - 40-58
LID - 10.1093/mmy/myv073 [doi]
AB  - Although there is growing understanding of the microenvironmental conditions
      fungal pathogens encounter as they colonize their host, nothing is known about
      Histoplasma capsulatum's response to hypoxia. Here we characterized hypoxia
      during murine histoplasmosis using an in vivo hypoxia detection agent,
      Hypoxyprobe-2 (HP-2); and analyzed H. capsulatum's transcriptional profile in
      response to in vitro hypoxia. Immunohistopathology and flow cytometry analyses
      revealed distinct regions of hypoxia during infection. Granuloma cells, enriched 
      with macrophages and T-cells isolated from infected livers were 66-76% positive
      for HP-2, of which, 95% of macrophages and 55% of T-cells were hypoxic. Although 
      inhibited, H. capsulatum was able to survive under in vitro hypoxic conditions
      (<1% O2), and restored growth when replaced in normoxia. Next-generation
      sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis after 24 hours of hypoxia demonstrated a
      significant increase in NIT50 (swirm domain DNA binding protein), a predicted ABC
      transporter (ABC), NADPH oxidoreductase (NADP/FAD), and guanine nucleotide
      exchange factor (RSP/GEF); and other genes with no known designated function.
      Computational transcription factor binding site analysis predicted human sterol
      regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) binding sites upstream of NIT50, ABC, 
      NADP/FAD and RSP/GEF. Hypoxia resulted in a time-dependent increase in the H.
      capsulatum homolog of SREBP, here named Srb1. Srb1 peaked at 8 hours and returned
      to basal levels by 24 hours. Our findings demonstrate that H. capsulatum
      encounters and survives severe hypoxia during infection. Additionally, the
      hypoxic response may be regulated at the level of transcription, and these
      studies contribute to the understanding of hypoxic regulation and adaptation in
      H. capsulatum.

      Protein.
PG  - 1-3
LID - 10.1089/aid.2015.0117 [doi]
AB  - ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters can transfer a variety of antiviral
      agents from the cytoplasm to body fluid, which results in a reduced intracellular
      concentration of the drugs. Proteins of HIV-1, e.g., Tat and gp120, altered some 
      types of ABC transporter expression in brain microvascular endothelial cells and 
      astrocytes. However, the effect of Tat on ABC transporters in T lymphocytes is
      unclear. In this study the status of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) in
      Tat expressing cell lines was examined with real-time PCR and flow cytometry. It 
      was found that HIV-1 Tat protein upregulated BCRP expression and enhanced efflux 
      mediated by BCRP significantly, which could inhibit antiviral drugs from entering
      infected cells and interfere with the therapeutic effect of HAART.

TI  - Relationship Between Cognitive Assessment and Balance Measures in Adolescents
      Referred for Vestibular Physical Therapy After Concussion.
PG  - 46-52
LID - 10.1097/JSM.0000000000000185 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between cognitive and balance performance 
      in adolescents with concussion. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING:
      Tertiary. PATIENTS: Sixty patients. INTERVENTIONS: Correlation analyses were
      performed to describe the relationship between symptoms, cognitive measure, and
      balance measure at the time of initiation of vestibular physical therapy. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Cognitive performance was assessed using the Immediate
      Post-concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT). The dizziness and
      balance function measures included dizziness severity rating, Activities-specific
      Balance Confidence scale (ABC), Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), Functional
      Gait Assessment, gait speed, Timed "UP and GO," Five Times Sit to Stand, and
      Sensory Organization Test (SOT). To account for multiple comparisons, the False
      Discovery Rate method was used. RESULTS: Performance measures of balance were
      significantly correlated with cognitive measures. Greater total symptom scores
      were related to greater impairment in the ABC and DHI (r = 0.35-0.39, P </=
      0.008) and worse performance in condition 2 of the SOT (r = -0.48, P = 0.004).
      Among the ImPACT composite scores, lower memory scores were correlated with
      impaired balance performance measures (r = 0.37-0.59, P </= 0.012). Lower visual 
      memory was also correlated with worse ABC scores. CONCLUSIONS: The significant
      relationships reported between the cognitive performance scores and balance
      measures may reflect that similar levels of functioning exist across domains in
      individuals with protracted recovery who receive vestibular physical therapy.
      CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The weak-to-moderate relationships warrant the continuous use
      of multiple domains of assessment. A better understanding to the relationships
      between the domains of functioning after concussion may improve the overall
      management approach for adolescents with concussion.

TI  - Greenhouse gas emissions from municipal solid waste management in Vientiane, Lao 
      PDR.
PG  - 30-7
LID - 10.1177/0734242X15615425 [doi]
AB  - Municipal solid waste (MSW) is one of the major environmental problems throughout
      the world including in Lao PDR. In Vientiane, due to the lack of a collection
      service, open burning and illegal dumping are commonly practised. This study aims
      to estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from the current situation of MSW
      management (MSWM) in Vientiane and proposes an alternative solution to reduce the
      GHG emission and environmental impacts. The 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on
      Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC
      2006 model) are used for the estimation of GHG emission from landfill and
      composting. For the estimation of GHG emission from open burning, the Atmospheric
      Brown Clouds Emission Inventory Manual (ABC EIM) is used. In Vientiane, a total
      of 232 505 tonnes year(-1) of MSW was generated in 2011. Waste generation in
      Vientiane is 0.69 kg per capita per day, and about 31% of the total MSW generated
      was directly sent to landfill (71 162 tonnes year(-1)). The total potential GHG
      emission from the baseline scenario in 2011 was 110 182 tonnes year(-1) CO2-eq,
      which is 0.15 tonne year(-1) CO2-eq per capita. From the three MSWM scenarios
      proposed, scenario S3, which includes recycling, composting and landfilling,
      seems to be an effective solution for dealing with MSW in Vientiane with less air
      pollution, and is environmentally friendly. The total GHG emission in scenario S3
      is reduced to 91 920 tonnes year(-1) CO2-eq (47% reduction), compared with the S1
      scenario where all uncollected waste is diverted to landfill.

TI  - In vitro and in vivo downregulation of the ATP binding cassette transporter B1 by
      the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin.

AB  - Extrusion of chemotherapeutics by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters like
      ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) represents a crucial mechanism of multidrug resistance in 
      cancer therapy. We have previously shown that the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
      coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor simvastatin directly inhibits ABCB1,
      alters the glycosylation of the transporter, and enhances the intracellular
      accumulation of doxorubicin with subsequent anti-cancer action. Here, we show
      that simvastatin reduces endogenous dolichol levels and ABCB1 in human
      neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Coapplication with dolichol prevents the
      downregulation of the ABCB1 transporter. Importantly, dolichol also attenuated
      simvastatin-induced apoptosis, unmasking involvement of unfolded protein
      response. Direct monitoring of the fluorescent fusion protein YFP-ABCB1 further
      confirms concentration-dependent reduction of ABCB1 in HEK293 cells by
      simvastatin. In simvastatin-treated murine xenografts, ABCB1 was also reduced in 
      the liver and rhabdomyosarcoma but did not reach significance in neuroblastoma.
      Nevertheless, the in vivo anti-cancer effects of simvastatin are corroborated by 
      increased apoptosis in tumor tissues. These findings provide experimental
      evidence for usage of simvastatin in novel chemotherapeutic regimens and link
      dolichol depletion to simvastatin-induced anti-cancer activity.

AB  - In this study, the transcriptional alterations in Penicillium chrysogenum under
      simulated microgravity conditions were analyzed for the first time using an
      RNA-Seq method. The increasing plethora of eukaryotic microbial flora inside the 
      spaceship demands the basic understanding of fungal biology in the absence of
      gravity vector. Penicillium species are second most dominant fungal contaminant
      in International Space Station. Penicillium chrysogenum an industrially important
      organism also has the potential to emerge as an opportunistic pathogen for the
      astronauts during the long-term space missions. But till date, the cellular
      mechanisms underlying the survival and adaptation of Penicillium chrysogenum to
      microgravity conditions are not clearly elucidated. A reference genome for
      Penicillium chrysogenum is not yet available in the NCBI database. Hence, we
      performed comparative de novo transcriptome analysis of Penicillium chrysogenum
      grown under microgravity versus normal gravity. In addition, the changes due to
      microgravity are documented at the molecular level. Increased response to the
      environmental stimulus, changes in the cell wall component ABC transporter/MFS
      transporters are noteworthy. Interestingly, sustained increase in the expression 
      of Acyl-coenzyme A: isopenicillin N acyltransferase (Acyltransferase) under
      microgravity revealed the significance of gravity in the penicillin production
      which could be exploited industrially.

TI  - Regulation of oligodendrocyte precursor maintenance by chondroitin sulphate
      glycosaminoglycans.
PG  - 270-86
LID - 10.1002/glia.22928 [doi]
AB  - Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) have been proven to inhibit
      morphological maturation of oligodendrocytes as well as their myelination
      capabilities. Yet, it remained unclear, whether CSPGs and/or their respective
      chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan (CS-GAG) side chains also regulate the
      oligodendrocyte lineage progression. Here, we initially show that CS-GAGs
      detected by the monoclonal antibody 473HD are expressed by primary rat
      NG2-positive oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and O4-positive immature
      oligodendrocytes. CS-GAGs become down-regulated with ongoing oligodendrocyte
      differentiation. Enzymatic removal of the CS-GAG chains by the bacterial enzyme
      Chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) promoted spontaneous differentiation of proliferating 
      rat OPCs toward O4-positive immature oligodendrocytes. Upon forced
      differentiation, the enzymatic removal of the CS-GAGs accelerated oligodendrocyte
      differentiation toward both MBP-positive and membrane forming oligodendrocytes.
      These processes were attenuated on enriched CSPG fractions, mainly consisting of 
      Phosphacan/RPTPbeta/zeta and to less extent of Brevican and NG2. To qualify
      CS-GAGs as universal regulators of oligodendrocyte biology, we finally tested the
      effect of CS-GAG removal on OPCs from different sources such as mouse cortical
      oligospheres, mouse spinal cord neurospheres, and most importantly human-induced 
      pluripotent stem cell-derived radial glia-like neural precursor cells. For all
      culture systems used, we observed a similar inhibitory effect of CS-GAGs on
      oligodendrocyte differentiation. In conclusion, this study clearly suggests an
      important fundamental principle for complex CS-GAGs to regulate the
      oligodendrocyte lineage progression. Moreover, the use of ChABC in order to
      promote oligodendrocyte differentiation toward myelin gene expressing cells might
      be an applicable therapeutic option to enhance white matter repair. GLIA

LID - 10.1002/ijc.29868 [doi]
AB  - Evidence of the association between chronic inflammation and the risk of
      colorectal cancer (CRC) and other obesity-related cancers (OBRC) remains
      inconsistent, possibly due to a paucity of studies examining repeated measures of
      inflammation. In the Health ABC prospective study of 2,490 adults aged 70-79
      years at baseline, we assessed whether circulating levels of three markers of
      systemic inflammation, IL-6, CRP and TNF-alpha, were associated with the risk of 
      CRC and OBRC, a cluster including cancers of pancreas, prostate, breast and
      endometrium. Inflammatory markers were measured in stored fasting blood samples. 
      While only baseline measures of TNF-alpha were available, IL-6 and CRP were
      additionally measured at Years 2, 4, 6 and 8. Multivariable Cox models were fit
      to determine whether tertiles and log-transformed baseline, updated and averaged 
      measures of CRP and IL-6 and baseline measures of TNF-alpha were associated with 
      the risk of incident cancer(s). During a median follow-up of 11.9 years, we
      observed 55 and 172 cases of CRC and OBRC, respectively. The hazard of CRC in the
      highest tertile of updated CRP was more than double that in the lowest tertile
      (HR = 2.29; 95% CI: 1.08-4.86). No significant associations were seen between
      colorectal cancer and IL-6 or TNF-alpha. Additionally, no significant
      associations were found between obesity-related cancers and the three
      inflammatory markers overall, but we observed a suggestion of effect modification
      by BMI and NSAID use. In summary, in this population, higher CRP levels were
      associated with increased risk of CRC, but not of OBRC. The findings provide new 
      evidence that chronically elevated levels of CRP, as reflected by repeated
      measures of this marker, may play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis in older
      adults.

LID - 10.1038/ncomms10515 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) have important biological roles in
      pathogenesis and intercellular interactions, but a general mechanism of OMV
      formation is lacking. Here we show that the VacJ/Yrb ABC (ATP-binding cassette)
      transport system, a proposed phospholipid transporter, is involved in OMV
      formation. Deletion or repression of VacJ/Yrb increases OMV production in two
      distantly related Gram-negative bacteria, Haemophilus influenzae and Vibrio
      cholerae. Lipidome analyses demonstrate that OMVs from VacJ/Yrb-defective mutants
      in H. influenzae are enriched in phospholipids and certain fatty acids.
      Furthermore, we demonstrate that OMV production and regulation of the VacJ/Yrb
      ABC transport system respond to iron starvation. Our results suggest a new
      general mechanism of OMV biogenesis based on phospholipid accumulation in the
      outer leaflet of the outer membrane. This mechanism is highly conserved among
      Gram-negative bacteria, provides a means for regulation, can account for OMV
      formation under all growth conditions, and might have important
      pathophysiological roles in vivo.

TI  - The feasibility of a train-the-trainer approach to end of life care training in
      care homes: an evaluation.
PG  - 11
LID - 10.1186/s12904-016-0081-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ABC End of Life Education Programme trained approximately 3000
      care home staff in End of Life (EoL) care. An evaluation that compared this
      programme with the Gold Standards Framework found that it achieved equivalent
      outcomes at a lower cost with higher levels of staff satisfaction. To consolidate
      this learning, a facilitated peer education model that used the ABC materials was
      piloted. The goal was to create a critical mass of trained staff, mitigate the
      impact of staff turnover and embed EoL care training within the organisations.
      The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of using a train the trainer
      (TTT) model to support EoL care in care homes. METHODS: A mixed method design
      involved 18 care homes with and without on-site nursing across the East of
      England. Data collection included a review of care home residents'
      characteristics and service use (n = 274), decedents' notes n = 150), staff
      interviews (n = 49), focus groups (n = 3), audio diaries (n = 28) and
      observations of workshops (n = 3). RESULTS: Seventeen care homes participated. At
      the end of the TTT programme 28 trainers and 114 learners (56 % of the targeted
      number of learners) had been trained (median per home 6, range 0-13). Three care 
      homes achieved or exceeded the set target of training 12 learners. Trainers
      ranged from senior care staff to support workers and administrative staff.
      Results showed a positive association between care home stability, in terms of
      leadership and staff turnover, and uptake of the programme. Care home ownership, 
      type of care home, size of care home, previous training in EoL care and resident 
      characteristics were not associated with programme completion. Working with
      facilitators was important to trainers, but insufficient to compensate for
      organisational turbulence. Variability of uptake was also linked to management
      support, programme fit with the trainers' roles and responsibilities and their
      opportunities to work with staff on a daily basis. CONCLUSION: When there is
      organisational stability, peer to peer approaches to skills training in end of
      life care can, with expert facilitation, cascade and sustain learning in care
      homes.

AB  - The development of therapeutics for neurological disorders is constrained by
      limited access to the central nervous system (CNS). ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
      transporters, particularly P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance
      protein (BCRP), are expressed on the luminal surface of capillaries in the CNS
      and transport drugs out of the endothelium back into the blood against the
      concentration gradient. Survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which is deficient
      in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), is a target of the ubiquitin proteasome system.
      Inhibiting the proteasome in a rodent model of SMA with bortezomib increases SMN 
      protein levels in peripheral tissues but not the CNS, because bortezomib has poor
      CNS penetrance. We sought to determine if we could inhibit SMN degradation in the
      CNS of SMA mice with a combination of bortezomib and the ABC transporter
      inhibitor tariquidar. In cultured cells we show that bortezomib is a substrate of
      P-gp. Mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that intraperitoneal
      co-administration of tariquidar increased the CNS penetrance of bortezomib, and
      reduced proteasome activity in the brain and spinal cord. This correlated with
      increased SMN protein levels and improved survival and motor function of SMA
      mice. These findings show that CNS penetrance of treatment for this neurological 
      disorder can be improved by inhibiting drug efflux at the blood-brain barrier.

TI  - MYD88 L265P mutations, but no other variants, identify a subpopulation of DLBCL
      patients of activated B-cell origin, extranodal involvement and poor outcome.
LID - clincanres.1525.2015 [pii]
AB  - PURPOSE: Mutations in MYD88 are found in different lymphoproliferative disorders 
      associated with particular biological characteristics and clinical impact. The
      aim of this study was to analyze the incidence of MYD88 mutations and its
      clinical impact in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:
      The incidence, clinico-biological features and outcome of 213 patients (115M/98F;
      median age 65 years) with DLBCL treated with immunochemotherapy in a single
      institution according to MYD88 mutational status as assessed by an
      allele-specific PCR assay were analyzed. The cell of origin (COO) was determined 
      in 129 cases by gene expression. RESULTS: MYD88 mutations were found in 47 cases 
      (22%) including L265P in 39 and S219C and M232F in 4 cases, respectively.
      Patients with MYD88 L265P were older, presenting frequent extranodal involvement 
      and mostly corresponded to activated B-cell like (ABC) subtype whereas no
      preference in COO was observed in patients with other MYD88 mutations. Five-year 
      overall survival (OS) for MYD88 wild type, MYD88 L265P and other variants was
      62%, 52% and 75%, respectively (p=0.05). IPI (HR=2.71; p<0.001) and MYD88 L265P
      (HR=1.786; p=0.023) were independent variables predicting OS in the multivariate 
      analysis. However, MYD88 L265P lost its independent value when COO was included
      in the model. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that MYD88 L265P mutations, but 
      no other variants, identify a subgroup of DLBCL mainly of ABC origin, with
      extranodal involvement and poor outcome.

TI  - Oncogenic CARMA1 couples NF-kappaB and beta-catenin signaling in diffuse large
      B-cell lymphomas.
LID - 10.1038/onc.2015.493 [doi]
AB  - Constitutive activation of the antiapoptotic nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)
      signaling pathway is a hallmark of the activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype of
      diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). Recurrent oncogenic mutations are found
      in the scaffold protein CARMA1 (CARD11) that connects B-cell receptor (BCR)
      signaling to the canonical NF-kappaB pathway. We asked how far additional
      downstream processes are activated and contribute to the oncogenic potential of
      DLBCL-derived CARMA1 mutants. To this end, we expressed oncogenic CARMA1 in the
      NF-kappaB negative DLBCL lymphoma cell line BJAB. By a proteomic approach we
      identified recruitment of beta-catenin and its destruction complex consisting of 
      APC, AXIN1, CK1alpha and GSK3beta to oncogenic CARMA1. Recruitment of the
      beta-catenin destruction complex was independent of CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 complex
      formation or constitutive NF-kappaB activation and promoted the stabilization of 
      beta-catenin. The beta-catenin destruction complex was also recruited to CARMA1
      in ABC DLBCL cell lines, which coincided with elevated beta-catenin expression.
      In line, beta-catenin was frequently detected in non-GCB DLBCL biopsies that rely
      on chronic BCR signaling. Increased beta-catenin amounts alone were not
      sufficient to induce classical WNT target gene signatures, but could augment
      TCF/LEF-dependent transcriptional activation in response to WNT signaling. In
      conjunction with NF-kappaB, beta-catenin enhanced expression of immunosuppressive
      interleukin-10 and suppressed antitumoral CCL3, indicating that beta-catenin can 
      induce a favorable tumor microenvironment. Thus, parallel activation of NF-kappaB
      and beta-catenin signaling by gain-of-function mutations in CARMA1 augments WNT
      stimulation and is required for regulating the expression of distinct NF-kappaB
      target genes to trigger cell-intrinsic and extrinsic processes that promote DLBCL
      lymphomagenesis.Oncogene advance online publication, 18 January 2016;

TI  - Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patient-derived xenograft models capture the
      molecular and biologic heterogeneity of the disease.
LID - blood-2015-09-672352 [pii]
AB  - Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a clinically and biologically
      heterogeneous disease defined by transcriptional classifications, specific
      signaling and survival pathways and multiple low-frequency genetic alterations.
      Preclinical model systems that capture the genetic and functional heterogeneity
      of DLBCL are urgently needed. We have generated and characterized a panel of LBCL
      Patient-derived Xenograft (PDX) models including 8 that reflect the
      immunophenotypic, transcriptional, genetic and functional heterogeneity of
      primary DLBCL and one that is a plasmablastic lymphoma. All LBCL PDX models were 
      subjected to whole transcriptome sequencing to classify cell of origin and
      consensus clustering classification (CCC) subtypes. Mutations and chromosomal
      rearrangements were evaluated by whole exome sequencing with an extended bait
      set. Six of the eight DLBCL models were ABC-type tumors that exhibited
      ABC-associated mutations such as MYD88, CD79B, CARD11 and PIM1. The remaining 2
      DLBCL PDX models were GCB-type, with characteristic alterations of GNA13, CREBBP 
      and EZH2, and chromosomal translocations involving IgH and either BCL2 or MYC.
      Only 25% (2/8) of the DLBCL PDX models harbored inactivating TP53 mutations
      whereas 75% (6/8) of tumors exhibited copy number alterations of TP53 or its
      upstream modifier, CDKN2A, consistent with the reported incidence and type of p53
      pathway alterations in primary DLBCL. By CCC criteria, 6/8 DLBCL PDX models were 
      BCR-type tumors that exhibited selective sIg expression and sensitivity to
      entospletinib, a recently developed SYK inhibitor. In summary, we have
      established and characterized faithful PDX models of DLBCL and demonstrated their
      usefulness in functional analyses of proximal BCR pathway inhibition.

TI  - Competitive Interaction Between Plasma Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Arachidonic Acid
      is Related to Down-Regulation of A Signaling Mediator.
AB  - Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may be attributed to altered composition of
      polyunsaturated fatty acids. We examined the relationships between the plasma
      ratios of docosahexaenoid acid (DHA)/arachidonic acid (AA) and eicopentaenoic
      acid (EPA)/AA, and biomarkers of AA-related signaling mediators, i.e.,
      ceruloplasmin, transferrin and superoxide dismutase, with the behavioral symptoms
      of 30 individuals with ASD (mean age, 13.0 years old) and 20 age- and
      gender-matched normal controls (mean age, 13.6 years old). Behavioral symptoms
      were assessed using the Aberrant Behavior Checklists (ABC). The ASD group had
      significantly higher plasma DHA/AA and EPA/AA ratios, as well as ABC scores,
      compared to the control group. The plasma ceruloplasmin levels in the ASD group
      were significantly reduced compared to those in the control group. Multiple
      linear regression demonstrated that plasma DHA/AA ratio was fitting models for
      distinguishing the ASD group from the control group. These findings suggested
      that increased plasma DHA/AA ratio may be related to lower plasma levels of
      ceruloplasmin, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of behavioral symptoms
      in 30 individuals with ASD.

TI  - Tariquidar Is an Inhibitor and Not a Substrate of Human and Mouse P-glycoprotein.
PG  - 275-82
LID - 10.1124/dmd.115.067785 [doi]
AB  - Since its development, tariquidar (TQR; XR9576;
      N-[2-[[4-[2-(6,7-Dimethoxy-3,4-dihydro-1H-isoquinolin-2-yl)ethyl]phenyl]carbamoyl
      ]-4,5-dimethoxyphenyl]quinoline-3-carboxamide) has been widely regarded as one of
      the more potent inhibitors of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an efflux transporter of the
      ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. A third-generation inhibitor, TQR 
      exhibits high affinity for P-gp, although it is also a substrate of another ABC
      transporter, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Recently, several studies
      have questioned the mechanism by which TQR interfaces with P-gp, suggesting that 
      TQR is a substrate for P-gp instead of a noncompetitive inhibitor. We
      investigated TQR and its interaction with human and mouse P-gp to determine if
      TQR is a substrate of P-gp in vitro. To address these questions, we used multiple
      in vitro transporter assays, including cytotoxicity, flow cytometry,
      accumulation, ATPase, and transwell assays. A newly generated BCRP cell line was 
      used as a positive control that demonstrates TQR-mediated transport. Based on our
      results, we conclude that TQR is a potent inhibitor of both human and mouse P-gp 
      and shows no signs of being a substrate at the concentrations tested. These in
      vitro data further support our position that the in vivo uptake of [(11)C]TQR
      into the brain can be explained by its high-affinity binding to P-gp and by it
      being a substrate of BCRP, followed by amplification of the brain signal by ionic
      trapping in acidic lysosomes.

TI  - Quantitative Proteomics Reveals Membrane Protein-Mediated Hypersaline Sensitivity
      and Adaptation in Halophilic Nocardiopsis xinjiangensis.
PG  - 68-85
LID - 10.1021/acs.jproteome.5b00526 [doi]
AB  - The genus Nocardiopsis is one of the most dominant Actinobacteria that survives
      in hypersaline environments. However, the adaptation mechanisms for halophilism
      are still unclear. Here, we performed isobaric tags for relative and absolute
      quantification based quantitative proteomics to investigate the functions of the 
      membrane proteome after salt stress. A total of 683 membrane proteins were
      identified and quantified, of which 126 membrane proteins displayed salt-induced 
      changes in abundance. Intriguingly, bioinformatics analyses indicated that these 
      differential proteins showed two expression patterns, which were further
      validated by phenotypic changes and functional differences. The majority of ABC
      transporters, secondary active transporters, cell motility proteins, and signal
      transduction kinases were up-regulated with increasing salt concentration,
      whereas cell differentiation, small molecular transporter (ions and amino acids),
      and secondary metabolism proteins were significantly up-regulated at optimum
      salinity, but down-regulated or unchanged at higher salinity. The small molecule 
      transporters and cell differentiation-related proteins acted as sensing proteins 
      that played a more important biological role at optimum salinity. However, the
      ABC transporters for compatible solutes, Na(+)-dependent transporters, and cell
      motility proteins acted as adaptive proteins that actively counteracted higher
      salinity stress. Overall, regulation of membrane proteins may provide a major
      protection strategy against hyperosmotic stress.

TI  - Multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 is a determinant of arsenite
      resistance.
PG  - 147-54
LID - 10.3892/or.2015.4343 [doi]
AB  - Although arsenic trioxide (arsenite, AsIII) has shown a remarkable efficacy in
      the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia patients, multidrug resistance is
      still a major concern for its clinical use. Multidrug resistance-associated
      protein 4 (MRP4), which belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of 
      transporters, is localized to the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes and the
      apical membrane of renal proximal tubule cells. Due to its characteristic
      localization, MRP4 is proposed as a candidate in the elimination of arsenic and
      may contribute to resistance to AsIII. To test this hypothesis, stable HEK293
      cells overexpressing MRP4 or MRP2 were used to establish the role of these two
      transporters in AsIII resistance. The IC50 values of AsIII in MRP4 cells were
      approximately 6-fold higher than those in MRP2 cells, supporting an important
      role for MRP4 in resistance to AsIII. The capacity of MRP4 to confer resistance
      to AsIII was further confirmed by a dramatic decrease in the IC50 values with the
      addition of MK571, an MRP4 inhibitor, and cyclosporine A, a well-known
      broad-spectrum inhibitor of ABC transporters. Surprisingly, the sensitivity of
      the MRP2 cells to AsIII was similar to that of the parent cells, although
      insufficient formation of glutathione and/or Se conjugated arsenic compounds in
      the MRP2 cells might limit transport. Given that MRP4 is a major contributor to
      arsenic resistance in vitro, further investigation into the correlation between
      MRP4 expression and treatment outcome of leukemia patients treated with
      arsenic-based regimens is warranted.

AB  - ABCG2 is one of three human ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters involved in
      the export from cells of a chemically and structurally diverse range of
      compounds. This multidrug efflux capability, together with a broad tissue
      distribution in the body, means that ABCG2 exerts a range of effects on normal
      physiology such as kidney urate transport, as well as contributing towards the
      pharmacokinetic profiles of many exogenous drugs. The primary sequence of ABCG2
      contains only half the number of domains required for a functioning ABC
      transporter and so it must oligomerise in order to function, yet its oligomeric
      state in intact cell membranes remains uncharacterized. We have analysed ABCG2 in
      living cell membranes using a combination of fluorescence correlation
      spectroscopy, photon counting histogram analysis, and stepwise photobleaching to 
      demonstrate a predominantly tetrameric structure for ABCG2 in the presence or
      absence of transport substrates. These results provide the essential basis for
      exploring pharmacological manipulation of oligomeric state as a strategy to
      modulate ABCG2 activity in future selective therapeutics.

TI  - Interglacial refugia preserved high genetic diversity of the Chinese mole shrew
      in the mountains of southwest China.
PG  - 23-32
LID - 10.1038/hdy.2015.62 [doi]
AB  - The mountains of southwest China (MSC) harbor extremely high species diversity;
      however, the mechanism behind this diversity is unknown. We investigated to what 
      degree the topography and climate change shaped the genetic diversity and
      diversification in these mountains, and we also sought to identify the locations 
      of microrefugia areas in these mountains. For these purposes, we sampled
      extensively to estimate the intraspecific phylogenetic pattern of the Chinese
      mole shrew (Anourosorex squamipes) in southwest China throughout its range of
      distribution. Two mitochondrial genes, namely, cytochrome b (CYT B) and NADH
      dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2), from 383 archived specimens from 43 localities
      were determined for phylogeographic and demographic analyses. We used the
      continuous-diffusion phylogeographic model, extensive Bayesian skyline plot
      species distribution modeling (SDM) and approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to
      explore the changes in population size and distribution through time of the
      species. Two phylogenetic clades were identified, and significantly higher
      genetic diversity was preserved in the southern subregion of the mountains. The
      results of the SDM, continuous-diffusion phylogeographic model, extensive
      Bayesian skyline plot and ABC analyses were congruent and supported that the Last
      Interglacial Maximum (LIG) was an unfavorable period for the mole shrews because 
      of a high degree of seasonality; A. squamipes survived in isolated interglacial
      refugia mainly located in the southern subregion during the LIG and rapidly
      expanded during the last glacial period. These results furnished the first
      evidence for major Pleistocene interglacial refugia and a latitudinal effect in
      southwest China, and the results shedding light on the higher level of species
      richness in the southern subregion.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of a novel therapeutic intervention called
      intraneural facilitation (INF) on balance measures and a neuropathy scale in
      patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. DESIGN: Prospective pre- and
      post-test, single group clinical trial. SETTING: Outpatient physical therapy
      clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
      INTERVENTION: Subjects received ten sessions of INF. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The
      modified total neuropathy scale (mTNS), the NeuroCom(R) Smart Balance Master
      system computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) that includes the sensory
      organization test (SOT) and the limits of stability (LOS), and the
      activities-specific balance and confidence (ABC) scale. RESULTS: Subjects in this
      study showed significant improvement in the mTNS, SOT, and one component in the
      LOS (movement velocity, MVL). There were no significant differences in the ABC or
      in 4 components of the LOS, which were reaction time (RT), endpoint excursion
      (EPE), maximum excursion (MXE), and directional control (DCL). CONCLUSION:
      Intraneural facilitation improved objective balance measures and neuropathy
      symptoms in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Further study is needed
      to determine long-term benefits of this intervention.

TI  - White matter volume in the brainstem and inferior parietal lobule is related to
      motor performance in children with autism spectrum disorder: A voxel-based
      morphometry study.
LID - 10.1002/aur.1605 [doi]
AB  - Many studies have reported poor motor performance in autism spectrum disorder
      (ASD); however, the underlying brain mechanisms remain unclear. Recent
      neuroimaging studies have suggested that abnormalities of the white matter (WM)
      are related to the features of ASD. In this study, we used voxel-based
      morphometry (VBM) to investigate which WM regions correlate with motor
      performance in children with ASD, and whether the WM volume in those brain
      regions differed between children with ASD and typically developing (TD)
      children. The subjects included 19 children with ASD and 20 TD controls. Motor
      performance was assessed using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children 2
      (M-ABC 2). Children with ASD showed poorer motor performance than did the
      controls. There was a significant positive correlation between the total test
      score on the M-ABC 2 and the volume of WM in the brainstem and WM adjacent to the
      left supramarginal gyrus (SMG). In addition, compared with the TD controls,
      children with ASD had a decreased volume of WM in the brainstem and adjacent to
      the left intraparietal sulcus, which is close to the SMG. These findings suggest 
      that structural changes in the WM in the brainstem and left inferior parietal
      lobule may contribute to poor motor performance in children with ASD. Autism Res

TI  - Inhibition of NF-kappaB Activity Enhances Sensitivity to Anticancer Drugs in
      Cholangiocarcinoma Cells.
PG  - 21-8
LID - 10.3727/096504015X14424348426071 [doi]
AB  - Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a dismal cancer. At present, there is no effective
      chemotherapeutic regimen for CCA. This may be due to the marked resistance of CCA
      to chemotherapy drugs, for which a mechanism remains unknown. Nuclear
      factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is constitutively activated in a variety of cancer
      cells, including CCA. It has been shown to play roles in growth, metastasis, and 
      chemoresistance of cancer. In the present study, we examined whether NF-kappaB is
      involved in the chemoresistance of CCA and whether dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin
      (DHMEQ), an effective NF-kappaB inhibitor, can overcome the drug resistance of
      CCA. Two CCA cell lines, KKU-M213 and KKU-M214, were treated with DHMEQ and/or
      chemotherapeutic drugs. Cell viability, apoptosis, and the expressions of the
      ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters were compared. The combination of
      chemotherapy drugs, 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, and doxorubicin, with DHMEQ
      significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of all chemotherapeutic drugs compared to
      DHMEQ or drug alone. Furthermore, the mRNA level of ABCB1, a multidrug-resistant 
      protein, was significantly decreased in the 5-fluorouracil combined with
      DHMEQ-treated cells. These findings suggest that the inhibition of NF-kappaB by
      DHMEQ enhanced the chemoresponsiveness of CCA cells, possibly by reducing the
      expression of ABC transporter. Inhibition of NF-kappaB may be a potential
      chemodrug-sensitizing strategy for chemoresistant cancer such as CCA.

AB  - Tissue and cancer stem cells are highly attractive target populations for
      regenerative medicine and novel potentially curative anticancer therapeutics. In 
      order to get a better understanding of stem cell biology and function, it is
      essential to reproducibly identify these stem cells from biological samples for
      subsequent characterization or isolation. ABC drug transporter expression is a
      hallmark of stem cells. This is utilized to identify (cancer) stem cells by
      exploiting their dye extrusion properties, which is referred to as the "side
      population assay." Initially described for high-end flow cytometers equipped with
      ultraviolet lasers, this technique is now also amenable for a broader scientific 
      community, owing to the increasing availability of violet laser-furnished
      cytometers and the advent of DyeCycle Violet (DCV). Here, we describe important
      technical aspects of the DCV-based side population assay and discuss potential
      pitfalls and caveats helping scientists to establish a valid and reproducible
      DCV-based side population assay. In addition, we investigate the suitability of
      blue laser-excitable DyeCycle dyes for side population detection. This knowledge 
      will help to improve and standardize detection and isolation of stem cells based 
      on their expression of ABC drug transporters.

TI  - A PDZ-Like Motif in the Biliary Transporter ABCB4 Interacts with the Scaffold
      Protein EBP50 and Regulates ABCB4 Cell Surface Expression.
PG  - e0146962
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0146962 [doi]
AB  - ABCB4/MDR3, a member of the ABC superfamily, is an ATP-dependent
      phosphatidylcholine translocator expressed at the canalicular membrane of
      hepatocytes. Defects in the ABCB4 gene are associated with rare biliary diseases.
      It is essential to understand the mechanisms of its canalicular membrane
      expression in particular for the development of new therapies. The stability of
      several ABC transporters is regulated through their binding to PDZ
      (PSD95/DglA/ZO-1) domain-containing proteins. ABCB4 protein ends by the sequence 
      glutamine-asparagine-leucine (QNL), which shows some similarity to PDZ-binding
      motifs. The aim of our study was to assess the potential role of the QNL motif on
      the surface expression of ABCB4 and to determine if PDZ domain-containing
      proteins are involved. We found that truncation of the QNL motif decreased the
      stability of ABCB4 in HepG2-transfected cells. The deleted mutant ABCB4-DeltaQNL 
      also displayed accelerated endocytosis. EBP50, a PDZ protein highly expressed in 
      the liver, strongly colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with ABCB4, and this
      interaction required the QNL motif. Down-regulation of EBP50 by siRNA or by
      expression of an EBP50 dominant-negative mutant caused a significant decrease in 
      the level of ABCB4 protein expression, and in the amount of ABCB4 localized at
      the canalicular membrane. Interaction of ABCB4 with EBP50 through its PDZ-like
      motif plays a critical role in the regulation of ABCB4 expression and stability
      at the canalicular plasma membrane.

PG  - e0146496
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0146496 [doi]
AB  - Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1) is a
      unique paracaspase protein whose protease activity mediates oncogenic NF-kappaB
      signalling in activated B cell-like diffuse large B cell lymphomas (ABC-DLBCLs). 
      ABC-DLBCLs are aggressive lymphomas with high resistance to current
      chemotherapies. Low survival rate among patients emphasizes the urgent need for
      alternative treatment options. The characterization of the MALT1 will be an
      essential tool for developing new target-directed drugs against MALT1 dependent
      disorders. As the first step in the atomic-level NMR studies of the system, here 
      we report, the 15N/13C/1H backbone assignment of the apo form of the MALT1
      paracaspase region together with the third immunoglobulin-like (Ig3) domain, 44
      kDa, by high resolution NMR. In addition, the non-uniform sampling (NUS) based
      targeted acquisition procedure is evaluated as a mean of decreasing acquisition
      and analysis time for larger proteins.

TI  - The Head Injury Transportation Straight to Neurosurgery (HITS-NS) randomised
      trial: a feasibility study.
PG  - 1-198
LID - 10.3310/hta20010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reconfiguration of trauma services, with direct transport of
      traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients to neuroscience centres (NCs), bypassing
      non-specialist acute hospitals (NSAHs), could potentially improve outcomes.
      However, delays in stabilisation of airway, breathing and circulation (ABC) and
      the difficulties in reliably identifying TBI at scene may make this practice
      deleterious compared with selective secondary transfer from nearest NSAH to NC.
      National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance and systematic reviews
      suggested equipoise and poor-quality evidence - with regard to 'early
      neurosurgery' in this cohort - which we sought to address. METHODS: Pilot cluster
      randomised controlled trial of bypass to NC conducted in two ambulance services
      with the ambulance station (n = 74) as unit of cluster [Lancashire/Cumbria in the
      North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) and the North East Ambulance Service (NEAS)].
      Adult patients with signs of isolated TBI [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of < 13
      in NWAS, GCS score of < 14 in NEAS] and stable ABC, injured nearest to a NSAH
      were transported either to that hospital (control clusters) or bypassed to the
      nearest NC (intervention clusters). PRIMARY OUTCOMES: recruitment rate, protocol 
      compliance, selection bias as a result of non-compliance, accuracy of paramedic
      TBI identification (overtriage of study inclusion criteria) and pathway
      acceptability to patients, families and staff. 'Open-label' secondary outcomes:
      30-day mortality, 6-month Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) and European
      Quality of Life-5 Dimensions. RESULTS: Overall, 56 clusters recruited 293 (169
      intervention, 124 control) patients in 12 months, demonstrating cluster
      randomised pre-hospital trials as viable for heath service evaluations. Overall
      compliance was 62%, but 90% was achieved in the control arm and when face-to-face
      paramedic training was possible. Non-compliance appeared to be driven by
      proximity of the nearest hospital and perceptions of injury severity and so
      occurred more frequently in the intervention arm, in which the perceived time to 
      the NC was greater and severity of injury was lower. Fewer than 25% of recruited 
      patients had TBI on computed tomography scan (n = 70), with 7% (n = 20) requiring
      neurosurgery (craniotomy, craniectomy or intracranial pressure monitoring) but a 
      further 18 requiring admission to an intensive care unit. An intention-to-treat
      analysis revealed the two trial arms to be equivalent in terms of age, GCS and
      severity of injury. No significant 30-day mortality differences were found (8.8% 
      vs. 9.1/%; p > 0.05) in the 273 (159/113) patients with data available. There
      were no apparent differences in staff and patient preferences for either pathway,
      with satisfaction high with both. Very low responses to invitations to consent
      for follow-up in the large number of mild head injury-enrolled patients meant
      that only 20% of patients had 6-month outcomes. The trial-based economic
      evaluation could not focus on early neurosurgery because of these low numbers but
      instead investigated the comparative cost-effectiveness of bypass compared with
      selective secondary transfer for eligible patients at the scene of injury.
      CONCLUSIONS: Current NHS England practice of bypassing patients with suspected
      TBI to neuroscience centres gives overtriage ratios of 13 : 1 for neurosurgery
      and 4 : 1 for TBI. This important finding makes studying the impact of bypass to 
      facilitate early neurosurgery not plausible using this study design. Future
      research should explore an efficient comparative effectiveness design for
      evaluating 'early neurosurgery through bypass' and address the challenge of
      reliable TBI diagnosis at the scene of injury. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current
      Controlled Trials ISRCTN68087745. FUNDING: This project was funded by the

TI  - COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF REAL-TIME PCR METHODS TO TYPING HLA-B*57:01 IN HIV- 1
      POSITIVE PATIENTS.
AB  - The HLA B*57:01 allele is strongly associated with the hypersensitivity reaction 
      to Abacavir (ABC). Therefore treatment guidelines recommend that patients
      initiating ABC are preventively tested for the presence of this allele. To date
      four different commercial assays based on the real-time (Q)-PCR technique are
      available for the detection of HLA-B*57:01: Duplicalpha-Real Time Reagent Set
      HLA-B*57:01 by Euroclone, HLA-B*57:01 Real-TM by Sacace Biotechnologies, COBAS
      AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HLA-B*57:01 Screening Test by Roche Diagnostic, and
      HLA-B*57:01 by Nuclear Laser Medicine. The study was carried out to compare the
      performance of the first three commercially available Q-PCR kits in a routine
      clinical setting. A total of 98 samples from Policlinico Umberto I Hospital were 
      tested. Results obtained by Duplicalpha-RealTime Genotyping kit and
      AmpliPrep/TaqMan system were 100% concordant. In contrast, genotyping by the
      HLA-B*57:01 Real-TM kit showed poor agreement with the other systems, i.e. 12 out
      of 33 positive samples were detected as HLA-B*57:01 negative. In order to confirm
      the correct genotype of these discordant samples, two additional methods with
      rapid turnaround times and already implemented into routine clinical practice
      were used, i.e. a PCR-based micro SSP DNA typing test and a laboratory-developed 
      screening test in Q-PCR. All 12 discordant samples were genotyped as HLA-B*57:01 
      positive samples using these two additional methods in a single-blinded manner,
      thus confirming the low sensitivity of HLA-B*57:01 Real-TM test. These findings
      underline the need to compare results obtained with commercial assays before
      choosing a test suitable for use in a routine clinical laboratory.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preclinical data suggest that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
      inhibitors (e.g. gefitinib) can delay endocrine resistance in breast cancer. A
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II trial investigated whether adding
      gefitinib (G) to anastrozole (A) would improve outcome in advanced breast cancer 
      (ABC). METHODS: Postmenopausal pre-treated hormone receptor-positive ABC patients
      (locally recurrent or metastatic) were 1:1 randomized to A (1 mg/d) plus G 250
      mg/d or plus placebo (P). Patients who had prior treatment with an aromatase
      inhibitor in metastatic setting or with trastuzumab, anti-EGFR or anti-VEGF
      agents were excluded. Treatment was given until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity or patient withdrawal. Progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 1 year
      was assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours, version 
      1.0. RESULTS: Of 108 planned patients, 71 were recruited (36 in A/G and 35 in
      A/P). The trial closed prematurely due to slow recruitment; 31 patients had prior
      chemotherapy and 53 prior endocrine therapy (all except one received tamoxifen); 
      60% in adjuvant and 16% in metastatic setting received tamoxifen; 59 patients had
      visceral disease. Median follow-up was 18 months. PFS rate at 1 year was 35% for 
      A/G and 32% for A/P arm. Objective responses were six (22%) in the A/G and nine
      (28%) in the A/P arm. Median duration of response was 13.8 and 18.6 months in the
      A/G and A/P arms, respectively. Fatigue (35%), diarrhoea (31%), rash (32%), dry
      skin (27%), and arthralgia/myalgia (27%) were the commonest adverse events in the
      A/G arm. CONCLUSIONS: This phase II study, although prematurely closed, did not
      show a signal that adding G to A improves PFS at 1 year and its use is not
      supported. Gastrointestinal and skin toxicities were more pronounced with G
      resulting in premature therapy interruption in almost 1 in 3 patients
      (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00066378).

AB  - Proadifen (SKF-525A) is a P450 monooxygenase inhibitor with potential
      anti-proliferative activity and the ability to potentiate the toxicity of
      hypericin-mediated photodynamic therapy and mitoxantrone via alteration of ABC
      transport proteins. Elevated expression of some ABC transporters may also
      determine the efficacy of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Thus, the purpose of this
      study was to investigate the ability of proadifen to sensitize A2780 and A2780cis
      ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin (CDDP). Herein, we show for the first time that
      proadifen sensitized resistant ovarian cancer cells to CDDP-induced cell death.
      The chemosensitizing effect of proadifen on CDDP action was also confirmed by MTT
      assays in multicellular spheroids. The possible mechanisms responsible for the
      enhanced cytotoxicity of proadifen/CDDP combined treatment may be attributed to a
      decrease of reduced relative glutathione levels, downregulation of multidrug
      resistance-associated proteins 1 and 2 (MRP1, MRP2) and attenuation of survivin
      expression. Taken together, our results indicate that proadifen is a promising
      compound for further in vivo experiments related to overcoming multidrug
      resistance and sensitization of resistant ovarian carcinoma to CDDP.

      responses.
PG  - 118-29
LID - 10.1111/imr.12380 [doi]
AB  - A subset of B cells with unique phenotypic and functional features-termed
      Age-associated B cells (ABCs)-has recently been identified in both mice and
      humans. These cells are characterized by a T-BET driven transcriptional program, 
      robust responsiveness to TLR7 and TLR9 ligands, and a propensity for IgG2a/c
      production. Beyond their age-related accumulation, these cells play roles in both
      normal and pathogenic humoral immune responses regardless of host age. Thus, B
      cells with the ABC phenotype and transcriptional signature appear during viral,
      bacterial, and parasitic infections, but also arise during humoral autoimmune
      disease in both mouse models and humans. These observations suggest that both
      autoantigens and certain classes of pathogens provide the signals required for
      ABC differentiation. Herein, we review the discovery and features of ABCs, and
      propose that they are a memory subset generated by nucleic acid-containing
      antigens in the context of a promoting inflammatory cytokine milieu.

AB  - Chemotherapy is the main cancer treatment and consists of drug administration
      that interferes with several metabolic pathways, leading to tumor cell death.
      Antimitotic drugs have a relevant role in chemotherapy. This study aimed to
      investigate the effect of a pyrimidinone derivative
      (6-(p-Anisyl)-2-(p-chlorophenyl)-4-oxo-3,4-dihydropyrimidine-5-carbonitrile,
      Py-09) on sea urchin embryonic development model. The effects of the compound
      were analyzed on fertilization, embryonic development, mitochondrial membrane
      potential (DeltaPsim), production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ABC
      transporter activity. Py-09 inhibited the fertilization and the embryonic
      development in a time and dose-dependent pattern, with the maximum effect at
      50muM (EC50=12.5muM). Py-09 induced the loss of DeltaPsim without altering ROS
      intracellular levels. Morphological changes were observed in the pattern of
      embryo cleavage (unequal cleavage) and at larval stages (fissures of spicules and
      pigment cell leakage). We also demonstrated that Py-09 is not an ABC transporter 
      substrate and the derivative does not circumvent the MXR phenomenon. Our study
      reports - for the first time - the antimitotic activity of Py-09 and stimulates
      new research on the potential of Py-09 as a pharmacological tool for in vitro
      studies, as well as its use as a new anticancer drug.

TI  - Genomic signature of successful colonization of Eurasia by the allopolyploid
      shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris).
PG  - 616-29
LID - 10.1111/mec.13491 [doi]
AB  - Polyploidization is a dominant feature of flowering plant evolution. However,
      detailed genomic analyses of the interpopulation diversification of polyploids
      following genome duplication are still in their infancy, mainly because of
      methodological limits, both in terms of sequencing and computational analyses.
      The shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris) is one of the most common weed
      species in the world. It is highly self-fertilizing, and recent genomic data
      indicate that it is an allopolyploid, resulting from hybridization between the
      ancestors of the diploid species Capsella grandiflora and Capsella orientalis.
      Here, we investigated the genomic diversity of C. bursa-pastoris, its population 
      structure and demographic history, following allopolyploidization in Eurasia. To 
      that end, we genotyped 261 C. bursa-pastoris accessions spread across Europe, the
      Middle East and Asia, using genotyping-by-sequencing, leading to a total of 4274 
      SNPs after quality control. Bayesian clustering analyses revealed three distinct 
      genetic clusters in Eurasia: one cluster grouping samples from Western Europe and
      Southeastern Siberia, the second one centred on Eastern Asia and the third one in
      the Middle East. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) supported the hypothesis 
      that C. bursa-pastoris underwent a typical colonization history involving low
      gene flow among colonizing populations, likely starting from the Middle East
      towards Europe and followed by successive human-mediated expansions into Eastern 
      Asia. Altogether, these findings bring new insights into the recent multistage
      colonization history of the allotetraploid C. bursa-pastoris and highlight ABC
      and genotyping-by-sequencing data as promising but still challenging tools to
      infer demographic histories of selfing allopolyploids.

AB  - Humic substances (HS) are complex and heterogeneous compounds of humified organic
      matter resulting from the chemical and microbiological decomposition of organic
      residues. HS have a positive effect on plant growth and development by improving 
      soil structure and fertility. They have long been recognized as plant
      growth-promoting substances, particularly with regard to influencing nutrient
      uptake, root growth and architecture. The biochemical and molecular mechanisms
      through which HS influence plant physiology are not well understood. This study
      evaluated the bioactivity of landfill leachate and leonardite HS on alder (Alnus 
      glutinosa L. Gaertn) and birch (Betula pendula Roth) during root elongation in
      vitro. Changes in root development were studied in relation to auxin, carbon and 
      nitrogen metabolisms, as well as to the stress adaptive response. The cDNA
      fragments of putative genes encoding two ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters 
      (ABCB1 and ABCB19) belonging to the B subfamily of plant ABC auxin transporters
      were cloned and sequenced. Molecular data indicate that HS and their humic acid
      (HA) fractions induce root growth by influencing polar auxin transport (PAT), as 
      illustrated by the modulation of the ABCB transporter transcript levels (ABCB1
      and ABCB19). There were also changes in alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and glutamine
      synthetase (GS) gene transcript levels in response to HS exposure. These findings
      confirmed that humic matter affects plant growth and development through various 
      metabolic pathways, including hormonal, carbon and nitrogen metabolisms and
      stress response or signalization.

AB  - Previous studies have indicated that the altered composition of polyunsaturated
      fatty acids (PUFAs) might contribute to the pathophysiology of autism spectrum
      disorder (ASD). We examined the relationship between the plasma fatty acid
      levels, expressed as mug/ml, and the plasma levels of biomarkers of AA-related
      signaling mediators, such as ceruloplasmin, transferrin and superoxide dismutase,
      and assessed the behavioral symptoms of 30 individuals with ASD (mean age,
      13.6+/-4.3 years old) compared with 20 age- and gender-matched normal controls
      (mean age, 13.2+/-5.4 years old) using Aberrant Behavior Checklists (ABC). The
      plasma levels of EPA and the plasma ratios of EPA/AA were significantly higher,
      while the plasma levels of AA and metabolites, such as 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic
      acid, adrenic acid, and ceruloplasmin (Cp), were significantly lower in the 30
      individuals with ASD compared with the 20 normal controls. The ABC scores were
      significantly increased in the ASD group compared with those of the control
      group. Thus, the results of the present study revealed that reduced plasma levels
      of AA and metabolites in association with high plasma EPA/AA ratios might
      down-regulate AA-related signaling mediators, such as Cp. Subsequently, reduced
      plasma Cp levels might reduce the protective capacity for brain damage, resulting
      in the pathophysiology underlying the behavioral symptoms in individuals with
      ASD. These findings suggest that reduced plasma AA levels may downregulate Cp.

TI  - [Aging Brain Care Program from Indianapolis : Transferability to the German
      healthcare system].
PG  - 32-6

AB  - BACKGROUND: New and innovative concepts of care management have been developed to
      improve the health of older adults with dementia and depression. AIM: This
      article describes the American aging brain care (ABC) program and the possible
      transfer to the German healthcare system is discussed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 
      ABC medical home model in Indianapolis incorporates a specialized geriatric
      heathcare center which is affiliated to the Eskenazi Hospital as well as a
      program involving home-based domestic visits by healthcare personnel to affected 
      people. The diagnoses are made in the geriatric center where therapy and
      treatment are also planned. These stages are carried out in a multiprofessional
      team, which identifies the individual needs of the patients and relatives and
      discusses these in family conferences as well as in close consultation with the
      primary care center of the hospital. The care, diagnosis and therapy are
      coordinated using a self-developed software for the program and via predetermined
      pathways and procedural intructions on the approach in the healthcare center and 
      in the domestic visit program. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: From the perspective of
      the authors the core elements of the program include not only the use of a
      home-based care model but also the selection and training of a new type of
      front-line care provider. Models like the program presented here show great
      promise for meeting the demands of a rapidly expanding population of vulnerable
      older adults.

TI  - Reconstitution of degenerated ovine lumbar discs by STRO-3-positive allogeneic
      mesenchymal precursor cells combined with pentosan polysulfate.
PG  - 1-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE Disc degeneration and associated low-back pain are major causes of
      suffering and disability. The authors examined the potential of mesenchymal
      precursor cells (MPCs), when formulated with pentosan polysulfate (PPS), to
      ameliorate disc degeneration in an ovine model. METHODS Twenty-four sheep had
      annular incisions made at L2-3, L3-4, and L4-5 to induce degeneration. Twelve
      weeks after injury, the nucleus pulposus of a degenerated disc in each animal was
      injected with ProFreeze and PPS formulated with either a low dose (0.1 million
      MPCs) or a high dose (0.5 million MPCs) of cells. The 2 adjacent injured discs in
      each spine were either injected with PPS and ProFreeze (PPS control) or not
      injected (nil-injected control). The adjacent noninjured L1-2 and L5-6 discs
      served as noninjured control discs. Disc height indices (DHIs) were obtained at
      baseline, before injection, and at planned death. After necropsy, 24 weeks after 
      injection, the spines were subjected to MRI and morphological, histological, and 
      biochemical analyses. RESULTS Twelve weeks after the annular injury, all the
      injured discs exhibited a significant reduction in mean DHI (low-dose group
      17.19%; high-dose group 18.01% [p < 0.01]). Twenty-four weeks after injections,
      the discs injected with the low-dose MPC+PPS formulation recovered disc height,
      and their mean DHI was significantly greater than the DHI of PPS- and
      nil-injected discs (p < 0.001). Although the mean Pfirrmann MRI disc degeneration
      score for the low-dose MPC+PPS-injected discs was lower than that for the nil-
      and PPS-injected discs, the differences were not significant. The disc morphology
      scores for the nil- and PPS-injected discs were significantly higher than the
      normal control disc scores (p < 0.005), whereas the low-dose MPC+PPS-injected
      disc scores were not significantly different from those of the normal controls.
      The mean glycosaminoglycan content of the nuclei pulposus of the low-dose
      MPC+PPS-injected discs was significantly higher than that of the PPS-injected
      controls (p < 0.05) but was not significantly different from the normal control
      disc glycosaminoglycan levels. Histopathology degeneration frequency scores for
      the low-dose MPC+PPS-injected discs were lower than those for the PPS- and
      Nil-injected discs. The corresponding high-dose MPC+PPS-injected discs failed to 
      show significant improvements in any outcome measure relative to the controls.
      CONCLUSIONS Intradiscal injections of a formulation composed of 0.1 million MPCs 
      combined with PPS resulted in positive effects in reducing the progression of
      disc degeneration in an ovine model, as assessed by improvements in DHI and
      morphological, biochemical, and histopathological scores.

TI  - Functional characterization of duplicated B-class MADS-box genes in Japanese
      gentian.
AB  - KEY MESSAGE: The heterodimer formation between B-class MADS-box proteins of
      GsAP3a and GsPI2 proteins plays a core role for petal formation in Japanese
      gentian plants. We previously isolated six B-class MADS-box genes (GsAP3a,
      GsAP3b, GsTM6, GsPI1, GsPI2, and GsPI3) from Japanese gentian (Gentiana scabra). 
      To study the roles of these MADS-box genes in determining floral organ
      identities, we investigated protein-protein interactions among them and produced 
      transgenic Arabidopsis and gentian plants overexpressing GsPI2 alone or in
      combination with GsAP3a or GsTM6. Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence
      complementation analyses revealed that among the GsPI proteins, GsPI2 interacted 
      with both GsAP3a and GsTM6, and that these heterodimers were localized to the
      nuclei. The heterologous expression of GsPI2 partially converted sepals into
      petaloid organs in transgenic Arabidopsis, and this petaloid conversion
      phenomenon was accelerated by combined expression with GsAP3a but not with GsTM6.
      In contrast, there were no differences in morphology between vector-control
      plants and transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing GsAP3a or GsTM6 alone.
      Transgenic gentian ectopically expressing GsPI2 produced an elongated tubular
      structure that consisted of an elongated petaloid organ in the first whorl and
      stunted inner floral organs. These results imply that the heterodimer formation
      between GsPI2 and GsAP3a plays a core role in determining petal and stamen
      identities in Japanese gentian, but other B-function genes might be important for
      the complete development of petal organs.

TI  - Long-term administration of tenofovir or emtricitabine to pregnant rats; effect
      on Abcb1a, Abcb1b and Abcg2 expression in the placenta and in maternal and fetal 
      organs.
PG  - 84-92

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Tenofovir and emtricitabine are very effective and well-tolerated
      antiretrovirals representing current backbone of the antiretroviral combination
      regimens for the prevention of perinatal HIV transmission. The aim of our study
      was to determine whether tenofovir or emtricitabine administered in long-term
      fashion affect expression of two widely described pharmacokinetic determinants,
      P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2), in maternal 
      or fetal biological tissues. METHODS: For this purpose, pregnant Wistar rats were
      administered tenofovir (2.25 mg/kg/day), emtricitabine (3.5 mg/kg/day) or saline 
      i.m. for 10 days (from the 12th to 21st gestation day). On the 22nd day, the
      placenta and maternal/fetal intestine, brain, kidneys and liver were sampled and 
      analysed for Abcb1a, Abcb1b and Abcg2 expression; placental and newborns' weights
      were also monitored. KEY FINDINGS: We found that long-term application of
      tenofovir or emtricitabine did not significantly affect expression of Abcb1a,
      Abcb1b and Abcg2 in either maternal or fetal organs. However, tenofovir
      administration significantly increased placenta-to-birthweight ratio, a strong
      indicator of various diseases occurring later in life. CONCLUSIONS: Our data
      broaden current knowledge on safety profile of tenofovir and emtricitabine use in
      pregnancy. Nevertheless, further research in other mammal species, including
      humans, is important to fully elucidate this issue.

TI  - Surface expression, peptide repertoire, and thermostability of chicken class I
      molecules correlate with peptide transporter specificity.
PG  - 692-7
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1511859113 [doi]
AB  - The chicken major histocompatibility complex (MHC) has strong genetic
      associations with resistance and susceptibility to certain infectious pathogens. 
      The cell surface expression level of MHC class I molecules varies as much as
      10-fold between chicken haplotypes and is inversely correlated with diversity of 
      peptide repertoire and with resistance to Marek's disease caused by an oncogenic 
      herpesvirus. Here we show that the average thermostability of class I molecules
      isolated from cells also varies, being higher for high-expressing MHC haplotypes.
      However, we find roughly the same amount of class I protein synthesized by high- 
      and low-expressing MHC haplotypes, with movement to the cell surface responsible 
      for the difference in expression. Previous data show that chicken TAP genes have 
      high allelic polymorphism, with peptide translocation specific for each MHC
      haplotype. Here we use assembly assays with peptide libraries to show that
      high-expressing B15 class I molecules can bind a much wider variety of peptides
      than are found on the cell surface, with the B15 TAPs restricting the peptides
      available. In contrast, the translocation specificity of TAPs from the
      low-expressing B21 haplotype is even more permissive than the promiscuous binding
      shown by the dominantly expressed class I molecule. B15/B21 heterozygote cells
      show much greater expression of B15 class I molecules than B15/B15 homozygote
      cells, presumably as a result of receiving additional peptides from the B21 TAPs.
      Thus, chicken MHC haplotypes vary in several correlated attributes, with the most
      obvious candidate linking all these properties being molecular interactions
      within the peptide-loading complex (PLC).

TI  - Non-native Conformers of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator NBD1
      Are Recognized by Hsp27 and Conjugated to SUMO-2 for Degradation.
PG  - 2004-17
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M115.685628 [doi]
AB  - A newly identified pathway for selective degradation of the common mutant of the 
      cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), F508del, is initiated
      by binding of the small heat shock protein, Hsp27. Hsp27 collaborates with Ubc9, 
      the E2 enzyme for protein SUMOylation, to selectively degrade F508del CFTR via
      the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin E3 ligase, RNF4 (RING finger protein 4) (1). Here, we
      ask what properties of CFTR are sensed by the Hsp27-Ubc9 pathway by examining the
      ability of NBD1 (locus of the F508del mutation) to mimic the disposal of
      full-length (FL) CFTR. Similar to FL CFTR, F508del NBD1 expression was reduced
      50-60% by Hsp27; it interacted preferentially with the mutant and was modified
      primarily by SUMO-2. Mutation of the consensus SUMOylation site, Lys(447),
      obviated Hsp27-mediated F508del NBD1 SUMOylation and degradation. As for FL CFTR 
      and NBD1 in vivo, SUMO modification using purified components in vitro was
      greater for F508del NBD1 versus WT and for the SUMO-2 paralog. Several findings
      indicated that Hsp27-Ubc9 targets the SUMOylation of a transitional, non-native
      conformation of F508del NBD1: (a) its modification decreased as [ATP] increased, 
      reflecting stabilization of the nucleotide-binding domain by ligand binding; (b) 
      a temperature-induced increase in intrinsic fluorescence, which reflects
      formation of a transitional NBD1 conformation, was followed by its SUMO
      modification; and (c) introduction of solubilizing or revertant mutations to
      stabilize F508del NBD1 reduced its SUMO modification. These findings indicate
      that the Hsp27-Ubc9 pathway recognizes a non-native conformation of mutant NBD1, 
      which leads to its SUMO-2 conjugation and degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome
      system.

TI  - Geography and end use drive the diversification of worldwide winter rye
      populations.
PG  - 500-14
LID - 10.1111/mec.13495 [doi]
AB  - To meet the current challenges in human food production, improved understanding
      of the genetic diversity of crop species that maximizes the selection efficacy in
      breeding programs is needed. The present study offers new insights into the
      diversity, genetic structure and demographic history of cultivated rye (Secale
      cereale L.). We genotyped 620 individuals from 14 global rye populations with a
      different end use (grain or forage) at 32 genome-wide simple sequence repeat
      markers. We reveal the relationships among these populations, their sizes and the
      timing of domestication events using population genetics and model-based
      inference with approximate Bayesian computation. Our main results demonstrate (i)
      a high within-population variation and genetic diversity, (ii) an unexpected
      absence of reduction in diversity with an increasing improvement level and (iii) 
      patterns suggestive of multiple domestication events. We suggest that the main
      drivers of diversification of winter rye are the end use of rye in two early
      regions of cultivation: rye forage in the Mediterranean area and grain in
      northeast Europe. The lower diversity and stronger differentiation of eastern
      European populations were most likely due to more intensive cultivation and
      breeding of rye in this region, in contrast to the Mediterranean region where it 
      was considered a secondary crop or even a weed. We discuss the relevance of our
      results for the management of gene bank resources and the pitfalls of inference
      methods applied to crop domestication due to violation of model assumptions and
      model complexity.

AB  - Cisplatin is one of the most commonly used chemotherapy drugs, treating a wide
      range of cancer types. Unfortunately, many cancers initially respond to platinum 
      treatment but when the tumor returns, drug resistance frequently occurs.
      Resistance to cisplatin is attributed to three molecular mechanisms: increased
      DNA repair, altered cellular accumulation, and increased drug inactivation. The
      use of precision medicine to make informed decisions on a patient's cisplatin
      resistance status and predicting the tumor response would allow the clinician to 
      tailor the chemotherapy program based on the biology of the disease. In this
      review, key biomarkers of each molecular mechanism will be discussed along with
      the current clinical research. Additionally, known polymorphisms for each
      biomarker will be discussed in relation to their influence on cisplatin
      resistance.

TI  - Convergent signaling pathways controlled by LRP1 cytoplasmic and extracellular
      domains limit cellular cholesterol accumulation.
LID - jbc.M116.714485 [pii]
AB  - The Low Density Lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a ubiquitously
      expressed cell surface receptor that protects from intracellular cholesterol
      accumulation. However, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here we show that
      the extracellular alpha chain of LRP1 mediates TGFbeta-induced enhancement of
      Wnt5a which limits intracellular cholesterol accumulation by inhibiting
      cholesterol biosynthesis and by promoting cholesterol export. We moreover
      demonstrate that the cytoplasmic (beta)chain of LRP1 suffices to limit
      cholesterol accumulation in LRP1-/- cells. Through binding of Erk2 to the second 
      of its carboxy-terminal NPxY motifs, LRP1 beta-chain positively regulates the
      expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and of neutral
      cholesterol ester hydrolase (NCEH1). These results highlight unexpected functions
      of LRP1 and the canonical Wnt5a pathway, and new therapeutic potential in
      cholesterol-associated disorders, including cardiovascular diseases.

TI  - Phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor of the brain without tumor-induced osteomalacia in
      an 8-year-old girl: case report.
PG  - 1-5
AB  - Phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor (mixed connective tissue variant) (PMT-MCT) are
      tumors that may cause tumor-induced osteomalacia and rarely appear
      intracranially. The authors describe the case of an 8-year-old girl who was found
      to have PMT-MCT with involvement of the cerebellar hemisphere and a small tumor
      pedicle breaching the dura mater and involving the skull. This was removed
      surgically in gross-total fashion without further complication. Histologically
      the tumor was confirmed to be a PMT-MCT. There was no evidence of tumor-induced
      osteomalacia. At the 42-month follow-up, the patient is doing well, has no
      abnormalities, and is free of recurrence. PMT-MCTs are rare tumors that may
      involve the brain parenchyma. A gross-total resection may be effective to cure
      these lesions.

AB  - Multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4) is a member of subfamily C of the
      ATP-binding cassette superfamily of membrane transport proteins. MRP4 mediates
      the ATP-dependent efflux of many endogenous and exogenous solutes across the
      plasma membrane, and in polarized cells, it localizes to the apical or
      basolateral plasma membrane depending on the tissue type. MRP4 is a 170 kDa
      glycoprotein and here we show that MRP4 is simultaneously N-glycosylated at
      Asn746 and Asn754. Furthermore, confocal immunofluorescence studies showed that
      N-glycans do not affect MRP4's apical membrane localization in polarized LLC-PK1 
      cells or basolateral membrane localization in polarized MDCKI cells. However,
      vesicular transport assays showed that N-glycans differentially affect MRP4's
      ability to transport prostaglandin E2, but not estradiol glucuronide. Together
      these data indicate that N-glycosylation at Asn746 and Asn754 is not essential
      for plasma membrane localization of MRP4 but cause substrate-selective effects on
      its transport activity.

TI  - Channel Gating Regulation by the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance
      Regulator (CFTR) First Cytosolic Loop.
PG  - 1854-65
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M115.704809 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we present data indicating a robust and specific domain
      interaction between the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
      (CFTR) first cytosolic loop (CL1) and nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD1) that
      allows ion transport to proceed in a regulated fashion. We used co-precipitation 
      and ELISA to establish the molecular contact and showed that binding kinetics
      were not altered by the common clinical mutation F508del. Both intrinsic ATPase
      activity and CFTR channel gating were inhibited severely by CL1 peptide,
      suggesting that NBD1/CL1 binding is a crucial requirement for ATP hydrolysis and 
      channel function. In addition to cystic fibrosis, CFTR dysregulation has been
      implicated in the pathogenesis of prevalent diseases such as chronic obstructive 
      pulmonary disease, acquired rhinosinusitis, pancreatitis, and lethal secretory
      diarrhea (e.g. cholera). On the basis of clinical relevance of the CFTR as a
      therapeutic target, a cell-free drug screen was established to identify
      modulators of NBD1/CL1 channel activity independent of F508del CFTR and
      pharmacologic rescue. Our findings support a targetable mechanism of CFTR
      regulation in which conformational changes in the NBDs cause reorientation of
      transmembrane domains via interactions with CL1 and result in channel gating.

TI  - The importance of drug transporters in human pluripotent stem cells and in early 
      tissue differentiation.
PG  - 77-92
LID - 10.1517/17425255.2016.1121382 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Drug transporters are large transmembrane proteins which catalyse
      the movement of a wide variety of chemicals, including drugs as well as xeno- and
      endobiotics through cellular membranes. The major groups of these proteins
      include the ATP-binding cassette transporters which in eukaryotes work as
      ATP-fuelled drug 'exporters' and the Solute Carrier transporters, with various
      transport directions and mechanisms. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we discuss
      the key ATP-binding cassette and Solute Carrier drug transporters which have been
      reported to contribute to the function and/or protection of undifferentiated
      human stem cells and during tissue differentiation. We review the various
      techniques for studying transporter expression and function in stem cells, and
      the role of drug transporters in foetal and placental tissues is also discussed. 
      We especially focus on the regulation of transporter expression by factors
      modulating cell differentiation properties and on the function of the
      transporters in adjustment to environmental challenges. EXPERT OPINION: The
      relatively new and as yet unexplored territory of transporters in stem cell
      biology may rapidly expand and bring important new information regarding the
      metabolic and epigenetic regulation of 'stemness' and the early differentiation
      properties. Drug transporters are clearly important protective and regulatory
      components in stem cells and differentiation.

TI  - Engineering Rhodosporidium toruloides with a membrane transporter facilitates
      production and separation of carotenoids and lipids in a bi-phasic culture.
PG  - 869-77
LID - 10.1007/s00253-015-7102-3 [doi]
AB  - The oleaginous yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides has great biotechnological
      potential. It accumulates a high amount of lipids which can be used for biofuels 
      and also produces carotenoids which are valuable in the food and pharmaceutical
      industry. However, the location of these two hydrophobic products in the cell
      membrane prohibits its efficient harvesting and separation. Here, the transporter
      Pdr10 was engineered into R. toruloides and cultured in two-phase media
      containing oil. This enabled the production and in situ export of carotenoids
      into the oil and concurrent separation from intracellular lipids in the cells.
      When Pdr10 strain was cultured in the two-phase media, carotenoids and fatty
      acids yield increased from 1.9 to 2.9 mug/mg and 0.07 to 0.09 mg/mg,
      respectively. A total of 1.8 mug/mg carotenoids was exported by Pdr10 strain, as 
      compared to 0.3 mug/mg in the wild type. In the Pdr10 strain, the composition of 
      carotenoids and fatty acid it produced also changed. Torulene became the major
      carotene produced instead of torularhodin. Also, the unsaturated fatty acid C18:2
      became the dominant fatty acid produced instead of the saturated C16:0, which was
      similar to the grape seed oil used in the two-phase media. This indicated that
      oil was being consumed by the cells, which was supported by the increased
      intracellular glycerol levels detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
      (GC-MS). Our approach represents an easy and greener extraction method which
      could serve to increase the yield and facilitate separation of carotenoids and
      fatty acids.

TI  - A Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism in ABCC4 Is Associated with Tenofovir-Related
      Beta2-Microglobulinuria in Thai Patients with HIV-1 Infection.
PG  - e0147724
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0147724 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Thailand, the combined generic anti-retroviral drug
      stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine (d4T/3TC/NVP) has been used to treat human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals since 2001. Due to relatively
      frequent adverse effects, d4T gradually has been replaced with tenofovir
      disoproxil fumarate (TDF). Although the frequency of adverse drug effects with
      TDF is lower than that with d4T, TDF is known to induce kidney dysfunction,
      especially in the proximal tubules. It has been reported that renal tubular
      transporters, including members of the multi-drug resistant (MDR) protein family,
      are implicated in tenofovir extrusion and may, therefore, confer susceptibility
      to TDF-induced kidney tubular dysfunction (KTD). We have explored the association
      between KTD and polymorphisms in genes that encode adenosine triphosphate-binding
      cassette (ABC)-type MDRs. METHODS: HIV-infected patients receiving TDF-containing
      antiretroviral regimens for at least one year were enrolled in the study. The
      levels of beta2-microglobulin in urine and creatinine (Cr) were measured. Three
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms, ABCC2 C-24T (rs717620), ABCC2 G1429A
      (rs2273697), and ABCC4 T4976C (rs1059751), were analyzed using TaqMan SNP
      genotyping assays. RESULTS: A total of 273 HIV-infected patients were recruited. 
      The median number of years of TDF treatment was 5.04 with interquartile range
      (IQR) of 3.9-6.7. Despite the length of treatment with TDF, 98.5% patients
      maintained an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of >60 mL/min as
      calculated by the CKD-EPI formula. Fifty-four patients (19.8%) showed
      beta2-microglobulinuria (median 2636 mug/g Cr with IQR of 1519-13197 mug/g Cr).
      The allele frequency of ABCC4 T4976C among those 54 patients was 0.602, compared 
      to 0.475 among the 219 remaining patients (p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately
      20% of HIV-infected patients receiving TDF showed beta2-microglobulinuria. The C 
      allele at position 4976 of the ABCC4 gene was associated with
      beta2-microglobulinuria in this population. This polymorphism may help to
      identify patients at greater risk for developing TDF-associated KTD.

TI  - Ursodeoxycholic Acid (UDCA) Exerts Anti-Atherogenic Effects by Inhibiting RAGE
      Signaling in Diabetic Atherosclerosis.
PG  - e0147839
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0147839 [doi]
AB  - A naturally occurring bile acid, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), is known to
      alleviate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress at the cellular level. However, the
      detailed action mechanisms of UDCA in atherosclerosis are not fully understood.
      In this study, we demonstrated whether UDCA exerts anti-atherogenic activity in
      diabetic atherosclerosis by targeting ER stress and "receptor for advanced
      glycation endproduct" (RAGE) signaling. UDCA markedly reduced ER stress, RAGE
      expression, and pro-inflammatory responses [including NF-kappaB activation and
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) production] induced in endothelial cells (ECs) by
      high glucose (HG). In particular, UDCA inhibited HG-induced ROS production by
      increasing the Nrf2 level. In macrophages, UDCA also blocked HG-induced RAGE and 
      pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and inhibited foam cell formation via
      upregulation of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, ABCA1 and ABCG1. In 
      the diabetic mouse model, UDCA inhibited atheromatous plaque formation by
      decreasing ER stress, and the levels of RAGE and adhesion molecules. In
      conclusion, UDCA exerts an anti-atherogenic activity in diabetic atherosclerosis 
      by targeting both ER stress and RAGE signaling. Our work implicates UDCA as a
      potential therapeutic agent for prevention or treatment of diabetic
      atherosclerosis.

TI  - Efflux transporter engineering markedly improves amorphadiene production in
      Escherichia coli.
LID - 10.1002/bit.25943 [doi]
AB  - Metabolic engineering aims at altering cellular metabolism to produce valuable
      products at high yields and titers. Achieving high titers and productivity can be
      challenging if final products are largely accumulated intracellularly. A
      potential solution to this problem is to facilitate the export of these
      substances from cells by membrane transporters. Amorphadiene, the precursor of
      antimalarial drug artemisinin, is known to be secreted from Escherichia coli
      over-expressing the biosynthetic pathway. In order to assess the involvement of
      various endogenous efflux pumps in amorphadiene transport, the effects of single 
      gene deletion of 16 known multidrug resistant membrane efflux transporters were
      examined. The outer membrane protein TolC was found to be intimately involved in 
      amorphadiene efflux. The overexpression of tolC together with ABC family
      transporters (macAB) or MFS family transporters (emrAB or emrKY) enhanced
      amorphadiene titer by more than threefold. In addition, the overexpression of
      transporters in the lipopolysaccharide transport system (msbA, lptD, lptCABFG)
      was found to improve amorphadiene production. As efflux transporters often have a
      wide range of substrate specificity, the multiple families of transporters were
      co-expressed and synergistic benefits were observed in amorphadiene production.
      This strategy of screening and then rationally engineering transporters can be
      used to improve the production of other valuable compounds in Escherichia coli.

TI  - RNA-seq transcriptional profiling of Herbaspirillum seropedicae colonizing wheat 
      (Triticum aestivum) roots.
AB  - Herbaspirillum seropedicae is a diazotrophic and endophytic bacterium that
      associates with economically important grasses promoting plant growth and
      increasing productivity. To identify genes related to bacterial ability to
      colonize plants, wheat seedlings growing hydroponically in Hoagland's medium were
      inoculated with H. seropedicae and incubated for 3 days. Total mRNA from the
      bacteria present in the root surface and in the plant medium were purified,
      depleted from rRNA and used for RNA-seq profiling. RT-qPCR analyses were
      conducted to confirm regulation of selected genes. Comparison of RNA profile of
      root attached and planktonic bacteria revealed extensive metabolic adaptations to
      the epiphytic life style. These adaptations include expression of specific
      adhesins and cell wall re-modeling to attach to the root. Additionally, the
      metabolism was adapted to the microxic environment and nitrogen-fixation genes
      were expressed. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) synthesis was activated, and PHB
      granules were stored as observed by microscopy. Genes related to plant growth
      promotion, such as auxin production were expressed. Many ABC transporter genes
      were regulated in the bacteria attached to the roots. The results provide new
      insights into the adaptation of H. seropedicae to the interaction with the plant.

TI  - Selection of Reference Genes for Real-Time Quantitative PCR in Pinus massoniana
      Post Nematode Inoculation.
PG  - e0147224
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0147224 [doi]
AB  - Pinus massoniaia Lamb has gained more and more attention as the most important
      tree species for timber and forestation in South China. Gene expression studies
      are of great importance to identify new and elite cultivars. Real-time
      quantitative PCR, a highly sensitive and specific method, is commonly used in the
      analysis of gene expression. The appropriate reference genes must be employed to 
      normalize the calculation program for ascertaining repeatable and significant
      results. Herein, eleven housekeeping genes were evaluated during different stages
      of P. massoniana post nematode inoculation in this study. Three statistical
      approaches such as geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper were selected to analyze the
      stability of candidate genes. The results indicated that U2af and beta-TUB were
      the most stable reference genes. These two genes could be used for the
      normalization in most of the experiments of P. massoniana, while Histone and AK
      were the least stable ones. In addition, EF expressed at the lowest average Ct
      value was the most abundant candidate gene. As an important gene associated with 
      defense mechanisms, ABC transporter was analyzed by qRT-PCR, and the results were
      used to confirm the reliability of two genes. The selected reference genes in the
      present study will be conducive to future gene expression normalized by qRT-PCR
      in P. massoniana.

TI  - Toxicity and tolerance of aluminum in plants: tailoring plants to suit to acid
      soils.
AB  - Aluminum (Al) stress is one of the serious limiting factors in plant productivity
      in acidic soils, which constitute about 50 % of the world's potentially arable
      lands and causes anywhere between 25 and 80 % of yield losses depending upon the 
      species. The mechanism of Al toxicity and tolerance has been examined in plants, 
      which is vital for crop improvement and enhanced food production in the future.
      Two mechanisms that facilitate Al tolerance in plants are Al exclusion from the
      roots and the ability to tolerate Al in the symplast or both. Although efforts
      have been made to unravel Al-resistant factors, many aspects remain unclear.
      Certain gene families such as MATE, ALMT, ASR, and ABC transporters have been
      implicated in some plants for resistance to Al which would enhance the
      opportunities for creating crop plants suitable to grow in acidic soils. Though
      QTLs have been identified related to Al-tolerance, no crop plant that is tolerant
      to Al has been evolved so far using breeding or molecular approaches. The
      remarkable changes that plants experience at the physiological, biochemical and
      molecular level under Al stress, the vast array of genes involved in Al
      toxicity-tolerance, the underlying signaling events and the holistic image of the
      molecular regulation, and the possibility of creating transgenics for Al
      tolerance are discussed in this review.

TI  - Human ATP-Binding Cassette transporter ABCG2 confers resistance to CUDC-907, a
      dual inhibitor of histone deacetylase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.
AB  - CUDC-907 is a novel, dual-acting small molecule compound designed to
      simultaneously inhibit the activity of histone deacetylase (HDAC) and
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Treatment with CUDC-907 led to sustained
      inhibition of HDAC and PI3K activity, inhibition of RAF-MEK-MAPK signaling
      pathway and cancer cell growth. CUDC-907 is currently under evaluation in phase I
      clinical trials in patients with lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and in patients
      with advanced solid tumors. However, the risk of developing acquired resistance
      to CUDC-907 can present a significant therapeutic challenge to clinicians in the 
      future, and should be investigated. The overexpression of ATP-binding cassette
      (ABC) drug transporter ABCB1, ABCC1 or ABCG2 is one of the most common mechanisms
      of developing multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancers and a major obstacle in
      chemotherapy. In this study, we reveal that ABCG2 reduces the intracellular
      accumulation of CUDC-907 and confers significant resistance to CUDC-907, which
      lead to reduced activity of CUDC-907 to inhibit HDAC and PI3K in human cancer
      cells. Moreover, although CUDC-907 affects the transport function of ABCG2, it
      was not potent enough to reverse drug resistance mediated by ABCG2 or affect the 
      expression level of ABCG2 in human cancer cells. Taken together, our findings
      indicate that ABCG2-mediated CUDC-907 resistance can have serious clinical
      implications and should be further investigated. More importantly, we demonstrate
      that the activity of CUDC-907 in ABCG2-overexpressing cancer cells can be
      restored by inhibiting the function of ABCG2, provides support for the rationale 
      of combining CUDC-907 with modulators of ABCG2 to improve the pharmacokinetics
      and efficacy of CUDC-907 in future treatment trials.

TI  - A Proteomic Analysis of Sarcoptes scabiei (Acari: Sarcoptidae).
LID - tjv247 [pii]
AB  - The pruritic skin disease scabies is caused by the burrowing of the itch mite
      Sarcoptes scabiei (De Geer). It is difficult to diagnose this disease because its
      symptoms often resemble those of other skin diseases. No reliable blood or
      molecular diagnostic test is available. The aim of this project was to begin to
      characterize the scabies proteome to identify scabies mite proteins, including
      those that may be useful in the development of a diagnostic test or vaccine.
      Various scabies mite extracts were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis, 
      and 844 Coomassie Blue-stained protein spots were excised, subjected to trypsin
      digestion, and analyzed by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization
      Time-Of-Flight/Time-Of-Flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry (MS). Tryptic
      fragment sequences determined by MS were searched against the recently completed 
      S. scabiei annotated genome, leading to the identification of >150 proteins. Only
      10 proteins hit to previously identified scabies proteins including actin,
      tropomyosin, and several ABC transporters. Thirteen proteins had homology to dust
      mite allergens (members of groups 8, 10, 13, 17, 20, 25, and 28). Most other
      sequences showed some homology to proteins in other mites and ticks including
      homologs of calmodulin, calreticulin, lipocalin, and glutathione-S-transferase.
      These data will now allow the identification of the proteins to which scabies
      patients produce antibodies, including those that may be good candidates for
      inclusion in a diagnostic test and vaccine.

TI  - Abca7 deletion does not affect adult neurogenesis in the mouse.
LID - BSR20150308 [pii]
AB  - ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 is highly expressed in the brain. Recent
      genome-wide association studies have identified ABCA7 SNPs that increase
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, however, the mechanisms by which ABCA7 may control
      AD risk remain to be fully elucidated. Based on previous research suggesting that
      certain ABC transporters may play a role in the regulation of neurogenesis, we
      conducted a study of cell proliferation and neurogenic potential using cellular
      bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and doublecortin immunostaining in adult Abca7
      deficient mice and wild type-like littermates. In the present study counting of
      bromodeoxyuridine-positive and doublecortin-positive cells in an established
      adult neurogenesis site in the dentate gyrus indicated there were no significant 
      differences when wild type and Abca7 deficient mice were compared. We also
      measured the area occupied by immunohistochemical staining for bromodeoxyuridine 
      and doublecortin in the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone of the same
      mice and this confirmed that ABCA7 does not play a significant role in the
      regulation of cell proliferation or neurogenesis in the adult mouse.

TI  - Mavoglurant in fragile X syndrome: Results of two randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trials.
PG  - 321ra5
LID - 10.1126/scitranslmed.aab4109 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common cause of inherited intellectual
      disability and autistic spectrum disorder, is typically caused by transcriptional
      silencing of the X-linked FMR1 gene. Work in animal models has described altered 
      synaptic plasticity, a result of the up-regulation of metabotropic glutamate
      receptor 5 (mGluR5)-mediated signaling, as a putative downstream effect. Post hoc
      analysis of a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover phase 2 trial suggested
      that the selective mGluR5 antagonist mavoglurant improved behavioral symptoms in 
      FXS patients with completely methylated FMR1 genes. We present the results of two
      phase 2b, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group studies of mavoglurant in FXS, designed to confirm this result in 
      adults (n = 175, aged 18 to 45 years) and adolescents (n = 139, aged 12 to 17
      years). In both trials, participants were stratified by methylation status and
      randomized to receive mavoglurant (25, 50, or 100 mg twice daily) or placebo over
      12 weeks. Neither of the studies achieved the primary efficacy end point of
      improvement on behavioral symptoms measured by the Aberrant Behavior
      Checklist-Community Edition using the FXS-specific algorithm (ABC-CFX) after 12
      weeks of treatment with mavoglurant. The safety and tolerability profile of
      mavoglurant was as previously described, with few adverse events. Therefore,
      under the conditions of our study, we could not confirm the mGluR theory of FXS
      nor the ability of the methylation state of the FMR1 promoter to predict
      mavoglurant efficacy. Preclinical results suggest that future clinical trials
      might profitably explore initiating treatment in a younger population with longer
      treatment duration and longer placebo run-ins and identifying new markers to
      better assess behavioral and cognitive benefits.

TI  - Purification and Partial Characterization of a Novel Bacteriocin Synthesized by
      Lactobacillus paracasei HD1-7 Isolated from Chinese Sauerkraut Juice.
PG  - 19366
LID - 10.1038/srep19366 [doi]
AB  - Bacteriocins have antimicrobial activities against food-spoiling bacteria and
      food-borne pathogens. Paracin 1.7, a bacteriocin synthesized by Lactobacillus
      paracasei HD1-7 isolated from Chinese sauerkraut juice, was studied. Following
      partial purification with ammonium sulfate precipitation, CM Sepharose Fast Flow,
      and Sephadex G-10 chromatography, the molecular weight of Paracin 1.7 was about
      10 kDa based on Tricine-SDS-PAGE results. A 2.87 fold purified bacteriocin was
      produced, reaching a final yield of 39.93% and the specific activity of 1.56 x
      10(3) AU/mg. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of Paracin 1.7 was VSNTFFA, and
      the LC/LTQ results revealed that the N-terminal amino acid sequence was similar
      to that of ABC-type oligopeptide transport system protein and
      N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase. Paracin 1.7 was sensitive to protease K, had 
      antimicrobial activities at a broad pH range (3.0-8.0), and was heat resistant
      (121 degrees C for 20 min). Paracin 1.7 from Lactobacillus paracasei HD1-7 is a
      novel bacteriocin that has potential applications in food preservation.

TI  - Adaptation to Parental Gender Transition: Stress and Resilience Among Transgender
      Parents.
AB  - Little is known about transgender parents and how they have negotiated their
      gender transition, referred to here as Parental Gender Transition (PGT), and
      subsequent stressors. This study addressed this gap using an adapted version of
      the ABC-X model and Family Stress Theory. The family functioning of 73
      transgender parents (72.2 % born male, 25.0 % born female, and 2.8 % other, e.g.,
      intersex), who transitioned after they had children, was examined in regard to
      the potential stresses associated with PGT (impact of disclosure, stigma, and
      boundary ambiguity), resources available to transitioning parents (social support
      and coping), and perception (sense of coherence and perceptions of PGT).
      Hierarchical multiple regression and path analysis were then conducted to
      determine if resources and perception altered the relationship between stress and
      family functioning. Findings from these transgender parents indicated an
      ameliorating role of sense of coherence, or the perception that they can handle
      the situation, on the relationship between stigma and family functioning, but not
      between boundary ambiguity, or confusion regarding who is in the family system,
      and family functioning. This suggests one avenue for professionals to intervene
      and help families through PGT. However, it also indicates the need for further
      research to determine ways to mitigate the impact of boundary ambiguity on family
      functioning.

TI  - Cerebral White Matter and Slow Gait: Contribution of Hyperintensities and
      Normal-appearing Parenchyma.
LID - glv224 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: White matter hyperintensities (WMH), a common marker of cerebral
      small vessel disease, and lower microstructural integrity of normal-appearing
      white matter are associated with slower gait. How these cerebral measures
      interact in relation to slower gait is unknown. We assessed whether
      microstructural integrity of normal-appearing white matter, measured by
      fractional anisotropy (FA), moderates the association of higher WMH with slower
      gait. METHODS: WMH, FA, and gait speed were acquired for 265 community-dwelling
      older adults (average age = 82.9 years). RESULTS: The inverse association between
      WMH and gait was robust to adjustment for age, gender, muscle strength, obesity, 
      stroke, and hypertension (fully adjusted model: betas = -0.19, p = .001). The
      interaction between WMH and FA was significant; analyses stratified by FA showed 
      that the inverse association between WMH and gait speed was significant only for 
      those with low FA (FA < median, fully adjusted model: betas = -0.28, p = .001).
      Voxel-based results were similar for participants with FA less than median, there
      was an inverse association between gait speed and WMH which extended throughout
      the white matter (genu and body of corpus callosum, anterior limb of internal
      capsule, corona radiata, and superior longitudinal and fronto-occipital
      fasciculus). In contrast, for participants with FA >/= median, the association
      was limited to the genu of corpus callosum, the cingulum, and the inferior
      longitudinal fasciculus. CONCLUSIONS: Microstructural integrity is a moderating
      factor in the association between WMH and gait. Future studies should examine
      whether higher microstructural integrity represents a source of compensation in
      those with greater WMH burden to maintain function in late life.

TI  - Elucidating the molecular physiology of lantibiotic NAI-107 production in
      Microbispora ATCC-PTA-5024.
PG  - 42
LID - 10.1186/s12864-016-2369-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The filamentous actinomycete Microbispora ATCC-PTA-5024 produces the 
      lantibiotic NAI-107, which is an antibiotic peptide effective against
      multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria. In actinomycetes, antibiotic
      production is often associated with a physiological differentiation program
      controlled by a complex regulatory and metabolic network that may be elucidated
      by the integration of genomic, proteomic and bioinformatic tools. Accordingly, an
      extensive evaluation of the proteomic changes associated with NAI-107 production 
      was performed on Microbispora ATCC-PTA-5024 by combining two-dimensional
      difference in gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry and gene ontology
      approaches. RESULTS: Microbispora ATCC-PTA-5024 cultivations in a complex medium 
      were characterized by stages of biomass accumulation (A) followed by biomass
      yield decline (D). NAI-107 production started at 90 h (A stage), reached a
      maximum at 140 h (D stage) and decreased thereafter. To reveal patterns of
      differentially represented proteins associated with NAI-107 production onset and 
      maintenance, differential proteomic analyses were carried-out on biomass samples 
      collected: i) before (66 h) and during (90 h) NAI-107 production at A stage; ii) 
      during three time-points (117, 140, and 162 h) at D stage characterized by
      different profiles of NAI-107 yield accumulation (117 and 140 h) and decrement
      (162 h). Regulatory, metabolic and unknown-function proteins, were identified and
      functionally clustered, revealing that nutritional signals, regulatory cascades
      and primary metabolism shift-down trigger the accumulation of protein components 
      involved in nitrogen and phosphate metabolism, cell wall biosynthesis/maturation,
      lipid metabolism, osmotic stress response, multi-drug resistance, and NAI-107
      transport. The stimulating role on physiological differentiation of a TetR-like
      regulator, originally identified in this study, was confirmed by the construction
      of an over-expressing strain. Finally, the possible role of cellular response to 
      membrane stability alterations and of multi-drug resistance ABC transporters as
      additional self-resistance mechanisms toward the lantibiotic was confirmed by
      proteomic and confocal microscopy experiments on a Microbispora ATCC-PTA-5024
      lantibiotic-null producer strain which was exposed to an externally-added amount 
      of NAI-107 during growth. CONCLUSION: This study provides a net contribution to
      the elucidation of the regulatory, metabolic and molecular patterns controlling
      physiological differentiation in Microbispora ATCC-PTA-5024, supporting the
      relevance of proteomics in revealing protein players of antibiotic biosynthesis
      in actinomycetes.

TI  - The mysterious orphans of Mycoplasmataceae.
PG  - 2
LID - 10.1186/s13062-015-0104-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The length of a protein sequence is largely determined by its
      function. In certain species, it may be also affected by additional factors, such
      as growth temperature or acidity. In 2002, it was shown that in the bacterium
      Escherichia coli and in the archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus, protein sequences
      with no homologs were, on average, shorter than those with homologs (BMC Evol
      Biol 2:20, 2002). It is now generally accepted that in bacterial and archaeal
      genomes the distributions of protein length are different between sequences with 
      and without homologs. In this study, we examine this postulate by conducting a
      comprehensive analysis of all annotated prokaryotic genomes and by focusing on
      certain exceptions. RESULTS: We compared the distribution of lengths of "having
      homologs proteins" (HHPs) and "non-having homologs proteins" (orphans or ORFans) 
      in all currently completely sequenced and COG-annotated prokaryotic genomes. As
      expected, the HHPs and ORFans have strikingly different length distributions in
      almost all genomes. As previously established, the HHPs, indeed are, on average, 
      longer than the ORFans, and the length distributions for the ORFans have a
      relatively narrow peak, in contrast to the HHPs, whose lengths spread over a
      wider range of values. However, about thirty genomes do not obey these rules.
      Practically all genomes of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma have atypical ORFans
      distributions, with the mean lengths of ORFan larger than the mean lengths of
      HHPs. These genera constitute over 80 % of atypical genomes. CONCLUSIONS: We
      confirmed on a ubiquitous set of genomes that the previous observation of HHPs
      and ORFans have different gene length distributions. We also showed that
      Mycoplasmataceae genomes have very distinctive distributions of ORFans lengths.
      We offer several possible biological explanations of this phenomenon, such as an 
      adaptation to Mycoplasmataceae's ecological niche, specifically its "quiet"
      co-existence with host organisms, resulting in long ABC transporters.

TI  - Global optimization of clusters of rigid molecules using the artificial bee
      colony algorithm.
PG  - 3003-10
LID - 10.1039/c5cp06313b [doi]
AB  - The global optimization of molecular clusters is an important topic encountered
      in many fields of chemistry. In our previous work (Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2015,
      17, 24173), we successfully applied the recently introduced artificial bee colony
      (ABC) algorithm to the global optimization of atomic clusters and introduced the 
      corresponding software "ABCluster". In the present work, ABCluster was extended
      to the optimization of clusters of rigid molecules. Here "rigid" means that all
      internal degrees of freedom of the constituent molecules are frozen. The
      algorithm was benchmarked by TIP4P water clusters (H2O)N (N </= 20), for which
      all global minima were successfully located. It was further applied to various
      clusters of different chemical nature: 10 microhydration clusters, 4 methanol
      microsolvation clusters, 4 nonpolar clusters and 2 ion-aromatic clusters. In all 
      the cases we obtained results consistent with previous experimental or
      theoretical studies.

TI  - The hematopoietic oncoprotein FOXP1 promotes tumor cell survival in diffuse large
      B-cell lymphoma by repressing S1PR2 signaling.
LID - blood-2015-08-662635 [pii]
AB  - Aberrant expression of the oncogenic transcription factor FOXP1 is a common
      feature of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We have combined chromatin
      immunoprecipitation and gene expression profiling after FOXP1 depletion with
      functional screening to identify targets of FOXP1 contributing to tumor cell
      survival. We find that the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) is
      repressed by FOXP1 in activated B-cell (ABC) and germinal center B-cell (GCB)
      DLBCL cell lines with aberrantly high FOXP1 levels; S1PR2 expression is further
      inversely correlated with FOXP1 expression in three patient cohorts. Ectopic
      expression of wild type S1PR2, but not of a point mutant incapable of activating 
      downstream signaling pathways, induces apoptosis in DLBCL cells and restricts
      tumor growth in subcutaneous and orthotopic models of the disease. The
      pro-apoptotic effects of S1PR2 are phenocopied by ectopic expression of the small
      G-protein Galpha13, but are independent of AKT signaling. We further show that
      low S1PR2 expression is a strong negative prognosticator of patient survival,
      alone and especially in combination with high FOXP1 expression. The S1PR2 locus
      has previously been demonstrated to be recurrently mutated in GCB DLBCL; the
      transcriptional silencing of S1PR2 by FOXP1 represents an alternative mechanism
      leading to inactivation of this important hematopoietic tumor suppressor.

TI  - Mother knows breast: A content analysis of breastfeeding in television network
      news.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - Major health organizations worldwide have touted the benefits of breastfeeding
      and engaged in campaigns to increase rates of practice. This study content
      analyzes network television news transcripts (N = 475) to investigate the
      coverage of breastfeeding over a 15-year time period (1999-2013) across three
      networks (ABC, NBC, CBS). Results revealed that although television news reports 
      on breastfeeding have steadily increased, topics have become more trivial.
      Reports were also found to heavily rely on episodic frames and primarily appear
      in morning news programs. Such coverage may have the ability to diminish the
      importance breastfeeding has on society and to deter policy advancement.
      Theoretical and practical implications for campaign development and promotion are
      discussed.

TI  - Suppression of HIV-1 Infectivity by Human Glioma Cells.
AB  - HIV-1 infection to the central nervous system (CNS) is very common in AIDS
      patients. The predominant cell types infected in the brain are monocytes and
      macrophages, which are surrounded by several HIV-1-resistant cell types, such as 
      astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, neurons, and microvascular cells. The effect of
      these HIV-1-resistant cells on HIV-1 infection is largely unknown. In this study,
      we examined the stability of HIV-1 cultured with several human glioblastoma cell 
      lines, for example, NP-2, U87MG, T98G, and A172, to determine whether these
      HIV-1-resistant brain cells could enhance or suppress HIV-1 infection and thus
      modulate HIV-1 infection in the CNS. The HIV-1 titer was determined using the
      MAGIC-5A indicator cell line as well as naturally occurring CD4+ T cells. We
      found that the stability of HIV-1 incubated with NP-2 or U87MG cells at 37
      degrees C was significantly shorter (half-life, 2.5-4 h) compared to that of
      HIV-1 incubated with T98G or A172 cells or in culture medium without cells
      (half-life, 8-18 h). The spent culture media (SCM) of NP-2 and U87MG cells had
      the ability to suppress both R5- and X4-HIV-1 infection by inhibiting HIV-1
      attachment to target cells. This inhibitory effect was eliminated by the
      treatment of the SCM with chondroitinase ABC but not heparinase, suggesting that 
      the inhibitory factor(s) secreted by NP-2 and U87MG cells was chiefly mediated by
      chondroitin sulfate (CS) or CS-like moiety. Thus, this study reveals that some
      but not all glioma cells secrete inhibitory molecules to HIV-1 infection that may
      contribute in lowering HIV-1 infection in the CNS in vivo.

AB  - Development of resistance represents a major drawback in osteosarcoma treatment, 
      despite improvements in overall survival. Treatment failure and tumor progression
      have been attributed to pre-existing drug-resistant clones commonly assigned to a
      cancer stem-like phenotype. Evidence suggests that non stem-like cells, when
      submitted to certain microenvironmental stimuli, can acquire a stemness phenotype
      thereby strengthening their capacity to handle with stressful conditions. Here,
      using osteosarcoma cell lines and a mouse xenograft model, we show that exposure 
      to conventional chemotherapeutics induces a phenotypic cell transition toward a
      stem-like phenotype. This associates with activation of Wnt/beta-catenin
      signaling, up-regulation of pluripotency factors and detoxification systems (ABC 
      transporters and Aldefluor activity) that ultimately leads to chemotherapy
      failure. Wnt/beta-catenin inhibition combined with doxorubicin, in the MNNG-HOS
      cells, prevented the up-regulation of factors linked to transition into a
      stem-like state and can be envisaged as a way to overcome adaptive resistance.
      Finally, the analysis of the public R2 database, containing microarray data
      information from diverse osteosarcoma tissues, revealed a correlation between
      expression of stemness markers and a worse response to chemotherapy, which
      provides evidence for drug-induced phenotypic stem cell state transitions in
      osteosarcoma.

AB  - Cronobacter is a group of important foodborne pathogens associated with neonatal 
      meningitis, septicemia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Among Cronobacter species,
      Cronobacter sakazakii is the most common species in terms of isolation frequency.
      However, the molecular basis involved in virulence differences among C. sakazakii
      isolates is still unknown. In this study, based on the determination of virulence
      differences of C. sakazakii G362 (virulent isolate) and L3101 (attenuated
      isolate) through intraperitoneal injection, histopathologic analysis (small
      intestine, kidney, and liver) further confirmed virulence differences.
      Thereafter, the potential virulence factors were determined using two-dimensional
      electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled with MALDI/TOP/TOF mass spectrometry. Among a
      total of 36 protein spots showing differential expression (fold change>1.2), we
      identified 31 different proteins, of which the expression abundance of 22 was
      increased in G362. These up-regulated proteins in G362 mainly contained DNA
      starvation/stationary phase protection protein Dps, OmpA, LuxS, ATP-dependent Clp
      protease ClpC, and ABC transporter substrate-binding proteins, which might be
      involved in virulence of C. sakazakii. This is the first report to determine the 
      potential virulence factors of C. sakazakii isolates at the proteomic levels.

AB  - A high-throughput, in-vitro assay for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticidal
      proteins designated as Cry was developed and evaluated for screening a large
      number of Cry protein variants produced by DNA shuffling. This
      automation-amenable assay exploits an insect cell line expressing a single
      receptor of Bt Cry proteins. The Cry toxin used to develop this assay is a
      variant of the Cry1Ab protein called IP1-88, which was produced previously by DNA
      shuffling. Cell mortality caused by the activated Bt Cry toxin was determined by 
      chemical cell viability assay in 96/384-well microtiter plates utilizing
      CellTiter 96((R)) obtained from Promega. A widely-accepted mode-of-action theory 
      of certain Bt Cry proteins suggests that the activated toxin binds to one or more
      receptors and forms a pore through the insect gut epithelial cell apical
      membrane. A number of insect proteins such as cadherin-like protein (Cad),
      aminopeptidase-N (APN), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and ABC transporter (ABCC)
      have been identified as the receptors of Bt Cry toxins. In this study, Bt Cry
      toxin receptors Ostrinia nubilalis (European corn borer) cadherin-like protein
      (On-Cad) and aminopeptidase-N 1 and 3 (On-APN1, On-APN3) and Spodoptera
      frugiperda (fall armyworm) cadherin-like protein (Sf-Cad) were cloned in an
      insect cell line, Sf21, and a mammalian cell line, Expi293F. It was observed by
      ligand blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy that trypsin-activated IP1-88
      bound to On-Cad and On-APN1, but not Sf-Cad or On-APN3. In contrast, IP1-88 bound
      only to APN1 in BBMV (Brush Border Membrane Vesicles) prepared from the third and
      fourth-instar O. nubilalis larval midgut. The sensitivity of the recombinant
      cells to the toxin was then tested. IP1-88 showed no toxicity to non-recombinant 
      Sf21 and Expi293F. Toxicity was observed only when the On-Cad gene was cloned and
      expressed. Sf-Cad and On-APN1 were not able to make those cells sensitive to the 
      toxin. Since the expression of On-Cad alone was sufficient to make both insect
      and mammalian cells sensitive to the IP1-88 toxin, it is not likely that a
      secondary receptor, which may exist specifically in the Sf21 insect cell but not 
      in the Expi293F cell, is involved in the cytotoxicity of IP1-88.

TI  - Low Plasma Klotho Concentrations and Decline of Knee Strength in Older Adults.
PG  - 103-8
LID - 10.1093/gerona/glv077 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the "anti-aging hormone" klotho is associated with
      sarcopenia in mice, the relationship between klotho and muscle strength in older 
      adults is not well known. METHODS: Plasma klotho concentrations were measured in 
      2,734 older adults, aged 71-80 years, who participated in the Health, Aging and
      Body Composition Study, a prospective observational cohort study conducted in
      Memphis, TN and Pittsburgh, PA. Knee extension strength was measured using
      isokinetic dynamometry at baseline and follow-up 2 and 4 years later. Knee
      extension strength was normalized for weight. RESULTS: At baseline, participants 
      in the highest tertile of plasma klotho had higher knee extension strength (beta 
      = .72, standard error [SE] = .018, p < .0001) compared with those in the lowest
      tertile in a multivariable linear regression model adjusting for age, sex, race, 
      smoking, study site, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and diabetes.
      Participants in the highest tertile of plasma klotho at baseline had less of a
      decline in knee strength over 4 years of follow-up (beta = -.025, SE = .011, p = 
      .02) compared with those in the lowest tertile in a multivariable linear
      regression model adjusting for the same covariates above. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma
      klotho concentrations were an independent predictor of changes in knee strength
      over time in older adults. Further studies are needed to identify the biological 
      mechanisms by which circulating klotho could modify skeletal muscle strength.

TI  - Depressive Trajectories and Risk of Disability and Mortality in Older Adults:
      Longitudinal Findings From the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study.
PG  - 228-35
LID - 10.1093/gerona/glv139 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression and disability are closely linked. Less is known regarding
      clinical and subclinical depressive symptoms over time and risk of disability and
      mortality. METHODS: Responses to the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Short
      Depression scale (CES-D10) were assessed over a 4-year period in men (n = 1032)
      and women (n = 1070) aged 70-79 years initially free from disability. Depressive 
      symptom trajectories were defined with group-based models. Disability (2
      consecutive reports of severe difficulty walking one-quarter mile or climbing 10 
      steps) and mortality were determined for 9 subsequent years. Hazard ratios (HRs) 
      were estimated using Cox proportional hazards adjusted for covariates. RESULTS:
      Three trajectories were identified: persistently nondepressed (54% of men, 54% of
      women, mean baseline CES-D10: 1.16 and 1.46), mildly depressed and increasing
      (40% of men, 38% of women, mean baseline CES-D10: 3.60 and 4.35), and depressed
      and increasing (6% of men, 8% of women, mean baseline CES-D10: 7.44 and 9.61).
      Disability and mortality rates per 1,000 person years were 41.4 and 60.3 in men
      and 45.8 and 41.9 in women. Relative to nondepressed, men in the mildly depressed
      (HR = 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-1.89) and depressed trajectories
      (HR = 2.12, 95% CI 1.33-3.38) had increased disability; women in the depressed
      trajectory had increased disability (HR = 2.02, 95% CI 1.37-2.96). Men in the
      mildly depressed (HR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.01-1.52) and depressed trajectories (HR =
      1.63, 95% CI 1.10-2.41) had elevated mortality risk; women exhibited no mortality
      risk. CONCLUSIONS: Trajectories of depressive symptoms without recovery may
      predict disability and mortality in apparently healthy older populations, thus
      underscoring the importance of monitoring depressive symptoms in geriatric care.

PG  - 25-33
LID - 10.3109/00498254.2015.1049576 [doi]
AB  - 1. Xenobiotics are metabolized and eliminated through the coordinated interplay
      of their metabolizing enzymes and transporters. However, these two activities in 
      vitro are measured separately, with the addition of ATP as a pre-requisite. 2. We
      propose a human renal cell-line model which integrates the sulfate and
      glutathione conjugation of xenobiotics with the efflux of their respective
      conjugates. Sulfation and glutathionylation represent two major Phase II
      detoxification of xenobiotics in man. The reactions are catalyzed, respectively, 
      by phenolsulfotransferase and glutathione-S-transferase followed by extrusion of 
      their respective conjugates. 3. Using Ko-143, a specific inhibitor of breast
      cancer resistance protein (BCRP), an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, we
      identified this transporter to be responsible for the efflux of p-cresol sulfate,
      harmol sulfate and the glutathione conjugate of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. 4.
      The conjugation-cum-efflux was inhibited by oligomycin and uncouplers, which
      highlights the role of cellular mitochondria in providing ATP for the
      biosynthesis of their conjugating agents, 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate
      (PAPS) and reduced glutathione as well as for the transport function of BCRP. 5. 
      The human 786-O renal cell-line provides a "3-in-1" system linking ATP
      biosynthesis to metabolism of xenobiotics and their ultimate transport and
      elimination by BCRP; this integrated system was not apparent in other human
      cell-lines examined.

TI  - Multidrug-Resistance Transporter AbcA Secretes Staphylococcus aureus Cytolytic
      Toxins.
PG  - 295-304

AB  - Phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) are Staphylococcus aureus cytolytic toxins that
      lyse erythrocytes and neutrophils and have important functions in the S. aureus
      infectious process. The molecular mechanisms of PSM secretion, however, are not
      well understood. Here we report that knockout of the multidrug-resistance ABC
      transporter AbcA, which contributes to S. aureus resistance against antibiotics
      and chemicals, diminished the secreted amount of PSM, leading to the accumulation
      of PSM in the intracellular fraction. The amount of PSM in the culture
      supernatants of the abcA knockout mutants was restored by introduction of the
      wild-type abcA gene, whereas it was not completely restored by introduction of
      mutant abcA genes encoding AbcA mutant proteins carrying amino acid substitutions
      in the adenosine triphosphate binding motifs. The abcA knockout mutant exhibited 
      attenuated virulence in a mouse systemic infection model. These findings suggest 
      that the multidrug resistance transporter AbcA secretes PSMs and contributes to
      S. aureus virulence.

TI  - Neural overexpression of multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 and refractory
      epilepsy: a meta-analysis of nine studies.
PG  - 308-17
LID - 10.3109/00207454.2015.1015724 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Overexpression of adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ATP-binding
      cassette (ABC)) transporters may contribute to intractable epilepsy (IE) by
      reducing brain accumulation of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). We conducted a
      meta-analysis of studies on expression and cellular distribution of multidrug
      resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) in IE patients to evaluate the
      contribution of this protein to AED resistance. In addition, we summarize
      experiments examining MRP1 expression and substrates in animal models of IE.
      METHODS: The literature search based on pre-established inclusion and exclusion
      criteria, as well as quality assessment, data extraction and statistical analyses
      were conducted concurrently by two independent researchers. We identified nine
      high-quality studies (Jadad score >/=3) published between 2000 and 2014 on the
      expression and cellular distribution of MRP1 in IE patients. A fixed effect model
      was used to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence
      intervals (95% CIs). Forest and funnel plots were constructed to assess study
      heterogeneity and publication bias, respectively. RESULTS: MRP1 expression was
      significantly higher in both astrocytes (OR = 17.04, 95% CI: 7.69-37.76, P <
      0.00001) and neurons (OR = 22.13, 95% CI: 8.52-57.46, P < 0.00001) of IE patients
      compared to controls, while there was no significant difference in endothelial
      cell MRP1 expression (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 0.09-1.79, P = 0.48). Funnel plot
      symmetry indicated no substantial publication bias. Most relevant preclinical
      studies from 2000 to 2014 found higher MRP1 expression in IE model rodents.
      Furthermore, MRP1 overexpression reduced the extracellular concentration of AEDs 
      in brain, while MRP1 inhibitors enhanced brain AED concentrations. CONCLUSION:
      Pooled results strongly suggest that MRP1 is overexpressed in both neurons and
      astrocytes of IE patients. Inhibition of MRP1 may enhance AED efficacy by
      increasing local drug availability.

TI  - Expression of ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters B1 and C1 after Severe Traumatic 
      Brain Injury in Humans.
PG  - 226-31
LID - 10.1089/neu.2015.3879 [doi]
AB  - Adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transport proteins ABCC1 and ABCB1 
      (also known as multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 and p-glycoprotein,
      respectively), are key membrane efflux transporters of drugs and endogenous
      substrates, including in the brain. The impact of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on
      ABCC1 and ABCB1 expression in humans is unknown. We hypothesized that ABCC1 and
      ABCB1 expression would be altered in brain tissue from patients acutely after
      severe TBI. Archived TBI samples (n=10) from our Brain Trauma Research Center and
      control samples (n=7) from our Alzheimer Disease Research Center were obtained
      under Institutional Review Board approval. Protein was extracted from fresh
      frozen cortical brain tissue for Western blot analysis and sections were obtained
      from fixed cortical tissue for immunohistochemistry. Relative abundance of ABCC1 
      was increased in samples from TBI versus controls (2.8+/-2.5 fold; p=0.005).
      ABCC1 immunohistochemistry was consistent with Western blot data, with increased 
      immunoreactivity in cerebral blood vessel walls, as well as cells with the
      morphological appearance of neurons and glia in TBI versus controls. Relative
      abundance of ABCB1 was similar between TBI and controls (p=0.76), and ABCB1
      immunoreactivity was primarily associated with cerebral blood vessels in both
      groups. These human data show that TBI increases ABCC1 expression in the brain,
      consistent with possible implications for both patients receiving pharmacological
      inhibitors and/or substrates of ABCC1 after TBI.

TI  - Antibiotic consumption in non-teaching Lebanese hospitals: A cross-sectional
      study.

LID - 10.1016/j.jiph.2015.12.013 [doi]
AB  - The rising threat of antibiotic resistance is linked to patterns of antibiotic
      use in hospital settings where global efforts are undertaken to encourage
      reporting and benchmarking antibiotic consumption in an attempt to improve
      prescription regimens. In Lebanon, where data concerning the level of antibiotic 
      consumption in hospitals is scarce, the aim of our paper is to track the
      intensity of antibiotic consumption in order to identify potential evidence of
      antibiotic misuse or abuse. The study is conducted in 2012 for a period of
      12-month using data from pharmacy records in 27 non-teaching Lebanese hospitals
      according to the Anatomical, Therapeutic and chemical classification system and
      Defined Daily Dose (ATC/DDD) recommended by the World Health Organization and
      compiling data on ABC Calc software version 3.1. Results show that the average
      antibiotic consumption excluding pediatric cases is 72.56 Defined Daily Dose per 
      100 Bed-Days (DDD/100BD). Total broad spectrum antibiotic consumption is 12.14
      DDD/100BD with no significant difference found between public and private
      hospitals (p>0.05 for all). The most commonly used antibiotics were
      Amoxycillin/Clavulanic acid, Ceftriaxone, Amoxycillin and Cefuroxime for
      parenteral use. Consumption of beta-lactams, Cephalosporins, Carbapenems,
      Monobactams and quinolones did not vary significantly by region, occupancy rate, 
      number of beds including the number of intensive care unit beds. Our data
      findings provides baseline information on patterns of antibiotic consumption in
      Lebanon and the issue calls for concerted efforts to encourage data reporting on 
      national basis and to correlate future findings with results of antibiotic
      susceptibility testing which can provide insights and tools needed to assess the 
      public health consequences of antimicrobial misuse and to evaluate the impact of 
      antibiotic resistance containment interventions.

TI  - Biological function of hpsh0459 localized in the plasticity zone of Helicobacter

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the biological function of hpsh0459 in H. 
      pylori. After Hpsh0459 was expressed using a prokaryotic expression system, the
      cytotoxic effects and IL-8 production of Hpsh0459 were analyzed by co-culturing
      with GES-1 cells. Meanwhile, the antibody of rHpsh0459, produced by immunizing
      rabbit, was used for localization and protein interaction studies. Hpsh0459
      fusion protein was expressed successfully in E. coli Rosetta (DE3), and the
      polyclonal antibody was produced at high titers. The MTT assay showed that the
      inhibition ratio of GES-1 cells cultured with 0.1mug/mL rHpsh0459 (3.02%+/-0.02%)
      was significantly lower than that of 20mug/mL rHpsh0459 (57.57%+/-0.03%, p<0.01),
      while DAPI staining showed the cytotoxic effects of rHpsh0459 for GES-1 cells.
      The up-regulation of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP was observed after GES-1 
      cells co-cultured with rHpsh0459 by Western blot. Co-culturing of GES-1 cells
      with rHpsh0459 (20mug/mL) led to significant production of IL-8 at 12
      h(1097.74+/-212.37 pg/mL) and 24h (1379.55+/-209.58 pg/mL) then at
      6h(134.68+/-14.64 pg/mL, p<0.01). These observations suggest that the
      cytotoxicity of Hpsh0459 occurred in a concentration dependent manner, which is
      related with IL-8 secretion from gastric mucosal epithelial cells. Hpsh0459 was
      found localized in the membrane and the periplasm of H. pylori, interacted with
      zinc finger protein and methionine ABC transporter ATP-binding protein, and
      potentially regulates DNA uptake or transfer.

TI  - Novel genes related to ceftriaxone resistance found among ceftriaxone-resistant
      Neisseria gonorrhoeae selected in vitro.
LID - AAC.00149-15 [pii]
AB  - The emergence of ceftriaxone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae is currently a
      global public health concern. But the mechanism of ceftriaxone resistance has not
      be fully understood hitherto. To investigate the potential genes related to
      ceftriaxone resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, we subcultured six gonococcal
      strains with increasing concentrations of ceftriaxone and isolated those that
      became resistant. After analyzing several frequently reported genes involved in
      ceftriaxone resistance, we only found a single mutation in penA (A501V). However,
      differential analysis of the genomes and transcriptomes between pre- and
      post-selection strains revealed many other mutated genes, as well as up- and
      down-regulated genes. Transformation of mutated gene penA into non-resistant
      strains increased the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) between 2.0- and
      5.3-fold, and transformation of mutated ftsX increased MIC between 3.3- and
      13.3-fold. Genes encoding ABC transporters, FarB, Tfq, Hfq, and ExbB were
      overexpressed while pilM,N, and Q were down-regulated. Furthermore, the resistant
      strain developed cross-resistance to penicillin and cefuroxime, had an increased 
      biochemical metabolic rate, and presented fitness defects such as prolonged
      growth time and down regulated PilMNQ. In conclusion, antimicrobial pressure
      could result in the emergence of ceftriaxone resistance, and the evolvement of
      Neisseria gonorrhoeae resistance to ceftriaxone is a complicated process at both 
      pre-transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels involving several resistance 
      mechanisms of increased efflux and decreased entry.

AB  - In this study, NMR-based metabolomics in combination with multivariate pattern
      recognition technologies were employed to evaluate the physiological variations
      in the Wistar rats' plasma that are induced by pregnancy on the gestational days 
      (GDs) 11, 14, 17 and 20. Untargeted metabolomics analysis revealed some possible 
      mechanism of physiological effects for healthy pregnancies and showed a metabolic
      trajectory during pregnancy process. The levels of 24 metabolites were found to
      change significantly throughout pregnancy in maternal plasma. These metabolite
      changes involved in varied kinds of metabolic pathways including synthesis of
      biological substances, microbial metabolism in diverse environments, protein
      digestion and absorption, carbohydrate metabolism, digestion and absorption,
      mineral absorption, and ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)-binding cassette
      transporters (ABC transporters). The substantial cores of all the metabolic
      pathways are promoting fetal growth and development and regulating maternal
      physiological state. This work showed relevant metabolic pathways perturbation in
      the maternal plasma due to normal pregnancy and provided the physical basis of
      time-dependent metabolic trajectory against which disease-related maternal
      physiological responses may be better understood in future studies.

TI  - Bicarbonate Concentration, Acid-Base Status, and Mortality in the Health, Aging, 
      and Body Composition Study.
LID - CJN.06200615 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Low serum bicarbonate associates with mortality in
      CKD. This study investigated the associations of bicarbonate and acid-base status
      with mortality in healthy older individuals. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, &
      MEASUREMENTS: We analyzed data from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition
      Study, a prospective study of well functioning black and white adults ages 70-79 
      years old from 1997. Participants with arterialized venous blood gas measurements
      (n=2287) were grouped into <23.0 mEq/L (low), 23.0-27.9 mEq/L (reference group), 
      and >/=28.0 mEq/L (high) bicarbonate categories and according to acid-base
      status. Survival data were collected through February of 2014. Mortality hazard
      ratios (HRs; 95% confidence intervals [95% CIs]) in the low and high bicarbonate 
      groups compared with the reference group were determined using Cox models
      adjusted for demographics, eGFR, albuminuria, chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease, smoking, and systemic pH. Similarly adjusted Cox models were performed
      according to acid-base status. RESULTS: The mean age was 76 years, 51% were
      women, and 38% were black. Mean pH was 7.41, mean bicarbonate was 25.1 mEq/L, 11%
      had low bicarbonate, and 10% had high bicarbonate. Mean eGFR was 82.1 ml/min per 
      1.73 m2, and 12% had CKD. Over a mean follow-up of 10.3 years, 1326 (58%)
      participants died. Compared with the reference group, the mortality HRs were 1.24
      (95% CI, 1.02 to 1.49) in the low bicarbonate and 1.03 (95% CI, 0.84 to 1.26) in 
      the high bicarbonate categories. Compared with the normal acid-base group, the
      mortality HRs were 1.17 (95% CI, 0.94 to 1.47) for metabolic acidosis, 1.21 (95% 
      CI, 1.01 to 1.46) for respiratory alkalosis, and 1.35 (95% CI, 1.08 to 1.69) for 
      metabolic alkalosis categories. Respiratory acidosis did not associate with
      mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In generally healthy older individuals, low serum
      bicarbonate associated with higher mortality independent of systemic pH and
      potential confounders. This association seemed to be present regardless of
      whether the cause of low bicarbonate was metabolic acidosis or respiratory
      alkalosis. Metabolic alkalosis also associated with higher mortality.

TI  - Motor imagery training for children with developmental coordination disorder -
      study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 5
LID - 10.1186/s12883-016-0530-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that the predictive control of movements 
      is impaired in children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), most
      likely due to a deficit in the internal modeling of movements. Motor imagery
      paradigms have been used to test this internal modeling deficit. The aim of the
      present study is to examine whether a training focused on the mental imagery of
      motor skills, can help to improve the motor abilities of children with DCD.
      METHODS/DESIGN: A pre-post design will be used to examine the motor performance, 
      motor imagery and motor planning abilities before and after a training of 9
      weeks. Two groups will be included in this study (1) one receiving motor imagery 
      (MI) training focused on the forward modeling of purposive actions, (2) one
      receiving Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance (CO-OP)
      training focused on identifying effective cognitive strategies that will increase
      motor competence. MI training will be given with the use of instruction videos of
      the motor skill that will be trained. Both groups will participate in 9
      individual sessions of 45 min (once a week) with a paediatric physical or
      occupational therapist, added with homework sessions. Inclusion criteria are: (1)
      aged 7-12 years, (2) meeting the DSM-V criteria for DCD (motor performance
      substantially low (score on the m-ABC </= 16th percentile) and motor problems
      that interfere with daily life (DCDQ, and request for help at a paediatric
      physical or occupational therapist)). Exclusion criteria are IQ < 70 and other
      medical conditions causing the motor impairment. DISCUSSION: The results of this 
      study will help to make treatment protocols for children with DCD more
      evidence-based. This study will increase our knowledge about the efficacy of both
      the MI training and CO-OP training, and both children with DCD and therapists
      will benefit from this knowledge. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Application of model-based approaches to evaluate hepatic transporter-mediated
      drug clearance: in vitro, in vivo, and in vitro-in vivo extrapolation.
AB  - Hepatic transporters, including efflux transporters (ABC family) and uptake
      transporters (SLC family), have been recognized to play an important role in the 
      disposition of various drugs. These membrane transporters show extensive
      substrate specificity with an abundant of overlap, implying the probability of
      transporter involved in the drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with other compounds.
      Thus reliable techniques are taken to evaluate the role of transporter-mediated
      drug disposition and possible effects on pharmacokinetics in the research. In the
      article, we give a summary on the techniques applied to evaluate the drug
      clearance mediated by hepatic transporters. The function of membrane transporters
      could be evaluated in vitro, in situ and in vivo, employing models spanning from 
      cell-based assay to transgenic mouse. Each technique has its own application with
      specific advantages and limitations. In addition, this article focuses
      particularly on the in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) of hepatic
      transporter-mediated drug clearance.

TI  - Overexpression of ABCC3 promotes cell proliferation, drug resistance, and aerobic
      glycolysis and is associated with poor prognosis in urinary bladder cancer
      patients.
AB  - Human urinary bladder cancer (UBC) is the one of the most common malignancies
      worldwide and occurs at a higher frequency in male individuals. ATP-binding
      cassette, subfamily C, member 3 (ABCC3), a member of the ABC transporter family, 
      is highly expressed in tumor cells, where it actively effluxes a broad spectrum
      of metabolites. However, the expression and role of ABCC3 in human UBC remains
      unclear. Our study aimed to identify the expression status of ABCC3 in UBC cases 
      and investigate the biological effects on UBC in cells. We found that both mRNA
      and protein levels of ABCC3 were significantly higher in UBC tissues than normal 
      tissues. Immunochemistry evaluation of ABCC3 expression in 122 UBC clinical
      specimens showed that high expression of ABCC3 had a positive correlation with
      UBC tumor size, advanced tumor node metastasis stage, and malignant histology.
      Moreover, high ABCC3 expression was linked to poor overall survival in UBC. ABCC3
      effects on cell proliferation and drug resistance were measured by colony
      formation and methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays.
      ABCC3-knockdown cells showed a significant decrease in cell growth and drug
      resistance. RNA interference of ABCC3 also caused downregulation of lactate
      dehydrogenase A (LDHA), which positively correlated with ABCC3 expression in UBC 
      specimens. In addition, cancer cell glycolytic ability was decreased upon ABCC3
      knockdown. The activity of LDHA was also abrogated in ABCC3-deficient UBC cells, 
      and the blockade of LDHA increased UBC cells sensitivity to Cis-diamine
      dichloroplatinum (CDDP). In summary, our study suggests ABCC3 is an important
      oncoprotein involved in glycolysis and drug resistance. These data also indicates
      that ABCC3 could be a potential prognostic marker and promising therapeutic
      target in UBC.

TI  - Investigating ABCB1-mediated drug-drug interactions: Considerations for in vitro 
      and in vivo assay design.
AB  - ABCB1 is a key ABC efflux transporter modulating the pharmacokinetics of a large 
      percentage of drugs. ABCB1 is also a site of transporter mediated drug-drug
      interactions (tDDI). It is the transporter most frequently tested for tDDIs both 
      in vitro and in the clinic. Understanding the limitations of various in vitro and
      in vivo models, therefore, is crucial. In this review we cover regulatory aspects
      of ABCB1 mediated drug transport as well as inhibition and the available models
      and methods. We also discuss protein structure and mechanistic aspects of
      transport as ABCB1 displayscomplex kinetics that involves multiple binding sites,
      potentiation of transport and probe-dependent IC50 values. Permeability of drugs 
      both passive and mediated by transporters is also a covariate that modulates
      apparent kinetic values. Levels of expression as well as lipid composition of the
      expression system used in in vitro studies have also been acknowledged as
      determinates of transporter activity. ABCB1-mediated clinical tDDI are often
      complex as multiple transporters as well as metabolic enzymes may play a role.
      This complexity often masks the role of ABCB1 in tDDIs. It is expected that
      utilization of in vitro data will further increase with the refinement of
      simulations. It is also anticipated that transporter humanized preclinical models
      have a significant impact and utility.

TI  - Association of Serum Erythropoietin With Cardiovascular Events, Kidney Function
      Decline, and Mortality: The Health Aging and Body Composition Study.
PG  - e002124
LID - 10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.115.002124 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies suggest that in patients with heart failure (HF), high serum 
      erythropoietin is associated with risk of recurrent HF and mortality. Trials of
      erythropoietin-stimulating agents in persons with kidney disease have also
      suggested an increased incidence of adverse clinical events. No large studies of 
      which we are aware have evaluated the association of endogenous erythropoietin
      levels with clinical outcomes in the community-living older adults. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: Erythropoietin concentration was measured in 2488 participants aged
      70-79 years in the Health, Aging and Body Composition Study. Associations of
      erythropoietin with incident HF, coronary heart disease, stroke, mortality, and
      >/=30% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate were examined using Cox
      proportional hazards and logistic regression over 10.7 years of follow-up. Mean
      (SD) age was 75 (3) years and median (quartile 1, quartile 3) erythropoietin was 
      12.3 (9.0, 17.2) mIU/mL. There were 503 incident HF events, and each doubling of 
      serum erythropoietin was associated with a 25% increased risk of incident HF 1.25
      (95% confidence interval 1.13, 1.48) after adjusting for demographics, prevalent 
      cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular disease risk factors, kidney function, and
      serum hemoglobin. There was no interaction of serum erythropoietin with chronic
      kidney disease or anemia (P>0.50). There were 330 incident coronary heart disease
      events, 161 strokes, 1112 deaths, and 698 outcomes of >/=30% decline in estimated
      glomerular filtration rate. Serum erythropoietin was not significantly associated
      with these outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of endogenous erythropoietin are 
      associated with incident HF in older adults. Studies need to elucidate the
      mechanisms through which endogenous erythropoietin levels associate with specific
      outcomes.

AB  - Brucella melitensis, encounters a very stressful environment in phagosomes,
      especially low pH levels. So identifying the genes that contribute to the
      replication and survival within an acidic environment is critical in
      understanding the pathogenesis of the Brucella bacteria. In our research,
      comparative transcriptome with RNA-seq were used to analyze the changes of genes 
      in normal-medium culture and in pH4.4-medium culture. The results reveal that 113
      genes expressed with significant differences (|log2Ratio| >/= 3); about 44% genes
      expressed as up-regulated. With GO term analysis, structural constituent of the
      ribosome, rRNA binding, structural molecule activity, and cation-transporting
      ATPase activity were significantly enriched (p-value </= 0.05). These genes
      distributed in 51 pathways, in which ribosome and photosynthesis pathways were
      significantly enriched. Six pathways (oxidative phosphorylation,
      iron-transporting, bacterial secretion system, transcriptional regulation,
      two-component system, and ABC transporters pathways) tightly related to the
      intracellular survival and virulence of Brucella were analyzed. A two-component
      response regulator gene in the transcriptional regulation pathway, identified
      through gene deletion and complementary technologies, played an important role in
      the resistance to the acid-resistance and virulence of Brucella.

TI  - Flagging Drugs That Inhibit the Bile Salt Export Pump.
PG  - 163-71
LID - 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.5b00594 [doi]
AB  - The bile salt export pump (BSEP) is an ABC-transporter expressed at the
      canalicular membrane of hepatocytes. Its physiological role is to expel bile
      salts into the canaliculi from where they drain into the bile duct. Inhibition of
      this transporter may lead to intrahepatic cholestasis. Predictive computational
      models of BSEP inhibition may allow for fast identification of potentially
      harmful compounds in large databases. This article presents a predictive in
      silico model based on physicochemical descriptors that is able to flag compounds 
      as potential BSEP inhibitors. This model was built using a training set of 670
      compounds with available BSEP inhibition potencies. It successfully predicted
      BSEP inhibition for two independent test sets and was in a further step used for 
      a virtual screening experiment. After in vitro testing of selected candidates, a 
      marketed drug, bromocriptin, was identified for the first time as BSEP inhibitor.
      This demonstrates the usefulness of the model to identify new BSEP inhibitors and
      therefore potential cholestasis perpetrators.

TI  - Comparative proteome analysis of Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110 grown with maltose or 
      glucose shows minor differences for acarbose biosynthesis proteins but major
      differences for saccharide transporters.

AB  - Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110 is known for the production of the alpha-glucosidase
      inhibitor and anti-diabetic drug acarbose. Acarbose (acarviosyl-maltose) is
      produced as the major product when the bacterium is grown in medium with maltose,
      while acarviosyl-glucose is the major product when glucose is the sole carbon
      source in the medium. In this study, a state-of-the-art proteomics approach was
      applied combining subcellular fractionation, in vivo metabolic labeling and
      shotgun mass spectrometry to analyze differences in the proteome of Actinoplanes 
      sp. SE50/110 cultures grown in minimal medium containing either maltose or
      glucose as the sole carbon source. To study proteins in distinct subcellular
      locations, a cytosolic, an enriched membrane, a membrane shaving and an
      extracellular fraction were included in the analysis. Altogether, quantitative
      proteome data was obtained for 2497 proteins representing about 30% of the ca.
      8270 predicted proteins of Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110. When comparing protein
      quantities of maltose- to glucose-grown cultures, differences were observed for
      saccharide transport and metabolism proteins, whereas differences for acarbose
      biosynthesis gene cluster proteins were almost absent. The maltose-inducible
      alpha-glucosidase/maltase MalL as well as the ABC-type saccharide transporters
      AglEFG, MalEFG and MstEAF had significantly higher quantities in the maltose
      growth condition. The only highly abundant saccharide transporter in the glucose 
      condition was the monosaccharide transporter MstEAF, which may indicate that
      MstEAF is the major glucose importer. Taken all findings together, the previously
      observed formation of acarviosyl-maltose and acarviosyl-glucose is more closely
      connected to the transport of saccharides than to a differential expression of
      the acarbose gene cluster. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Diabetes is a global pandemic
      accounting for about 11% of the worldwide healthcare expenditures (>600 billion
      US dollars) and is projected to affect 592 million people by 2035 (www.idf.org). 
      Whether Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110 produces type 2 diabetes drug acarbose
      (acarviosyl-maltose) or another acarviose metabolite such as acarviosyl-glucose
      as the major product depends on the offered carbon source. The differences
      observed in this proteome in this study suggest that the differences in the
      formation of acarviosyl-maltose and acarviosyl-glucose are more closely connected
      to the transport of saccharides than to a differential expression of the acarbose
      gene cluster. In addition, the present study provides a comprehensive overview of
      the proteome of Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110.

AB  - The human brain readily perceives fluent movement from static input. Using
      functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated brain mechanisms that
      mediate fluent apparent biological motion (ABM) perception from sequences of body
      postures. We presented body and nonbody stimuli varying in objective sequence
      duration and fluency of apparent movement. Three body postures were ordered to
      produce a fluent (ABC) or a nonfluent (ACB) apparent movement. This enabled us to
      identify brain areas involved in the perceptual reconstruction of body movement
      from identical lower-level static input. Participants judged the duration of a
      rectangle containing body/nonbody sequences, as an implicit measure of movement
      fluency. For body stimuli, fluent apparent motion sequences produced subjectively
      longer durations than nonfluent sequences of the same objective duration. This
      difference was reduced for nonbody stimuli. This body-specific bias in duration
      perception was associated with increased blood oxygen level-dependent responses
      in the primary (M1) and supplementary motor areas. Moreover, fluent ABM was
      associated with increased functional connectivity between M1/SMA and right
      fusiform body area. We show that perceptual reconstruction of fluent movement
      from static body postures does not merely enlist areas traditionally associated
      with visual body processing, but involves cooperative recruitment of motor areas,
      consistent with a "motor way of seeing".

TI  - Resolution of Brassicaceae Phylogeny Using Nuclear Genes Uncovers Nested
      Radiations and Supports Convergent Morphological Evolution.
PG  - 394-412
LID - 10.1093/molbev/msv226 [doi]
AB  - Brassicaceae is one of the most diverse and economically valuable angiosperm
      families with widely cultivated vegetable crops and scientifically important
      model plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana. The evolutionary history, ecological,
      morphological, and genetic diversity, and abundant resources and knowledge of
      Brassicaceae make it an excellent model family for evolutionary studies. Recent
      phylogenetic analyses of the family revealed three major lineages (I, II, and
      III), but relationships among and within these lineages remain largely unclear.
      Here, we present a highly supported phylogeny with six major clades using nuclear
      markers from newly sequenced transcriptomes of 32 Brassicaceae species and large 
      data sets from additional taxa for a total of 55 species spanning 29 out of 51
      tribes. Clade A consisting of Lineage I and Macropodium nivale is sister to
      combined Clade B (with Lineage II and others) and a new Clade C. The ABC clade is
      sister to Clade D with species previously weakly associated with Lineage II and
      Clade E (Lineage III) is sister to the ABCD clade. Clade F (the tribe
      Aethionemeae) is sister to the remainder of the entire family. Molecular clock
      estimation reveals an early radiation of major clades near or shortly after the
      Eocene-Oligocene boundary and subsequent nested divergences of several tribes of 
      the previously polytomous Expanded Lineage II. Reconstruction of ancestral
      morphological states during the Brassicaceae evolution indicates prevalent
      parallel (convergent) evolution of several traits over deep times across the
      entire family. These results form a foundation for future evolutionary analyses
      of structures and functions across Brassicaceae.

      Deinococcus radiodurans.
PG  - 43-51
LID - 10.1007/s00203-015-1163-7 [doi]
AB  - Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) serves as a quorum-sensing signaling molecule that mediates 
      both intraspecies and interspecies communication among bacteria, and plays
      critical roles in regulating various bacterial behaviors. In the present study,
      we investigated the functions of AI-2 signaling in the extremophilic bacterium
      Deinococcus radiodurans R1 by construction of the LuxS gene disruption mutant,
      survival phenotype assay and gene transcription assay. The gene mutant
      (DRDeltaLuxS), which was unable to produce AI-2, was significantly more sensitive
      to both gamma radiation and H2O2 compared with the wild-type strain. Addition of 
      the wild-type-derived spent medium into the cell culture of DRDeltaLuxS fully
      restored the radioresistance of D. radiodurans. A higher level of reactive oxygen
      species accumulated in the mutant compared with the wild type under normal or
      oxidative stress. Quantitative real-time PCR assays showed that transcriptional
      levels of stress-related proteins, including catalase, extracellular nuclease,
      Dps-1 and ABC transporters, were decreased in DRDeltaLuxS, indicating that AI-2
      is involved in regulation of stress-related genes of D. radiodurans. Hence, AI-2 
      signaling may contribute to the extreme resistance of D. radiodurans to radiation
      and oxidative stresses.

TI  - Macrophage-mediated cholesterol handling in atherosclerosis.
PG  - 17-28
LID - 10.1111/jcmm.12689 [doi]
AB  - Formation of foam cells is a hallmark at the initial stages of atherosclerosis.
      Monocytes attracted by pro-inflammatory stimuli attach to the inflamed vascular
      endothelium and penetrate to the arterial intima where they differentiate to
      macrophages. Intimal macrophages phagocytize oxidized low-density lipoproteins
      (oxLDL). Several scavenger receptors (SR), including CD36, SR-A1 and lectin-like 
      oxLDL receptor-1 (LOX-1), mediate oxLDL uptake. In late endosomes/lysosomes of
      macrophages, oxLDL are catabolysed. Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) hydrolyses
      cholesterol esters that are enriched in LDL to free cholesterol and free fatty
      acids. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), acyl coenzyme A: cholesterol
      acyltransferase-1 (ACAT1) in turn catalyses esterification of cholesterol to
      store cholesterol esters as lipid droplets in the ER of macrophages. Neutral
      cholesteryl ester hydrolases nCEH and NCEH1 are involved in a secondary
      hydrolysis of cholesterol esters to liberate free cholesterol that could be then 
      out-flowed from macrophages by cholesterol ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
      transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 and SR-BI. In atherosclerosis, disruption of lipid
      homoeostasis in macrophages leads to cholesterol accumulation and formation of
      foam cells.

TI  - Does climate directly influence NPP globally?
PG  - 12-24
LID - 10.1111/gcb.13079 [doi]
AB  - The need for rigorous analyses of climate impacts has never been more crucial.
      Current textbooks state that climate directly influences ecosystem annual net
      primary productivity (NPP), emphasizing the urgent need to monitor the impacts of
      climate change. A recent paper challenged this consensus, arguing, based on an
      analysis of NPP for 1247 woody plant communities across global climate gradients,
      that temperature and precipitation have negligible direct effects on NPP and only
      perhaps have indirect effects by constraining total stand biomass (Mtot ) and
      stand age (a). The authors of that study concluded that the length of the growing
      season (lgs ) might have a minor influence on NPP, an effect they considered not 
      to be directly related to climate. In this article, we describe flaws that
      affected that study's conclusions and present novel analyses to disentangle the
      effects of stand variables and climate in determining NPP. We re-analyzed the
      same database to partition the direct and indirect effects of climate on NPP,
      using three approaches: maximum-likelihood model selection, independent-effects
      analysis, and structural equation modeling. These new analyses showed that about 
      half of the global variation in NPP could be explained by Mtot combined with
      climate variables and supported strong and direct influences of climate
      independently of Mtot , both for NPP and for net biomass change averaged across
      the known lifetime of the stands (ABC = average biomass change). We show that lgs
      is an important climate variable, intrinsically correlated with, and contributing
      to mean annual temperature and precipitation (Tann and Pann ), all important
      climatic drivers of NPP. Our analyses provide guidance for statistical and
      mechanistic analyses of climate drivers of ecosystem processes for predictive
      modeling and provide novel evidence supporting the strong, direct role of climate
      in determining vegetation productivity at the global scale.

TI  - Distinct mechanisms contribute to immunity in the lantibiotic NAI-107 producer
      strain Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024.
PG  - 118-32
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.12892 [doi]
AB  - The investigation of self-resistance in antibiotic producers is important to
      understand the emergence of antibiotic resistance in pathogens and to improve
      antibiotic production. Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized antibiotics that 
      mostly target peptidoglycan biosynthesis. The actinomycete Microbispora ATCC
      PTA-5024 produces the lantibiotic NAI-107, which interferes with peptidoglycan
      biosynthesis by binding bactoprenol-pyrophosphate-coupled peptidoglycan
      precursors. In order to understand how Microbispora counteracts the action of its
      own antibiotic, its peptidoglycan composition was analysed in detail.
      Microbispora peptidoglycan consists of muropeptides with D-Ala and Gly in similar
      proportion at the fourth position of the peptide stems and alternative 3-3
      cross-links besides the classical 4-3 cross-links. In addition, the NAI-107
      biosynthetic gene cluster (mlb) was analysed for the expression of immunity
      proteins. We show that distinct immunity determinants are encoded in the mlb
      cluster: the ABC transporter MlbYZ acting cooperatively with the transmembrane
      protein MlbJ and the lipoprotein MlbQ. NMR structural analysis of MlbQ revealed a
      hydrophobic surface patch, which is proposed to bind the cognate lantibiotic.
      This study demonstrates that immunity in Microbispora is not only based on one
      determinant but on the action of the distinct immunity proteins MlbQ, MlbYZ and
      MlbJ.

TI  - Apolipoprotein E Allele and Hearing Thresholds in Older Adults.
PG  - 34-9
LID - 10.1177/1533317514537549 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 allele status which is associated 
      with an increased risk of cognitive decline is also associated with hearing
      impairment is unknown. METHODS: We studied 1833 men and women enrolled in the
      Health, Aging and Body Composition study. Regression models adjusted for
      demographic and cardiovascular risk factors were used to assess the
      cross-sectional association of APOE-E4 status with individual pure tone hearing
      thresholds and the 4-frequency pure tone average (0.5-4 kHz) in the better
      hearing ear. RESULTS: Compared to participants with no APOE-E4 alleles,
      participants with 1 allele had better thresholds at 4.0 kHz (beta = -2.72 dB, P =
      .013) and 8.0 kHz (beta = -3.05 kHz, P = .006), and participants with 2 alleles
      had better hearing thresholds at 1.0 kHz (beta = -8.56 dB, P = .021). CONCLUSION:
      Our results suggest that APOE-E4 allele status may be marginally associated with 
      better hearing thresholds in older adults.

TI  - Global Regulation of Gene Expression by the MafR Protein of Enterococcus
      faecalis.
PG  - 1521
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2015.01521 [doi]
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis is a natural inhabitant of the human gastrointestinal
      tract. However, as an opportunistic pathogen, it is able to colonize other host
      niches and cause life-threatening infections. Its adaptation to new environments 
      involves global changes in gene expression. The EF3013 gene (here named mafR) of 
      E. faecalis strain V583 encodes a protein (MafR, 482 residues) that has sequence 
      similarity to global response regulators of the Mga/AtxA family. The enterococcal
      OG1RF genome also encodes the MafR protein (gene OG1RF_12293). In this work, we
      have identified the promoter of the mafR gene using several in vivo approaches.
      Moreover, we show that MafR influences positively the transcription of many genes
      on a genome-wide scale. The most significant target genes encode components of
      PTS-type membrane transporters, components of ABC-type membrane transporters, and
      proteins involved in the metabolism of carbon sources. Some of these genes were
      previously reported to be up-regulated during the growth of E. faecalis in blood 
      and/or in human urine. Furthermore, we show that a mafR deletion mutant strain
      induces a significant lower degree of inflammation in the peritoneal cavity of
      mice, suggesting that enterococcal cells deficient in MafR are less virulent. Our
      work indicates that MafR is a global transcriptional regulator. It might
      facilitate the adaptation of E. faecalis to particular host niches and,
      therefore, contribute to its potential virulence.

TI  - Activated protein C resistance in cirrhotic patients Interest of thrombinography.
AB  - Cirrhosis is associated with complex hemostatic modifications. Most coagulation
      factors, either procoagulants or anticoagulants, are reduced. Conventional
      coagulation tests (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time) don't
      allow to precisely identify the thrombotic risk as they are not sensible to
      coagulation inhibitors deficiencies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
      coagulation in a population of cirrhotic patients using thrombinography. We
      analyzed the plasma samples from 30 cirrhotic patients (10 Child A, 10 Child B,
      Child C 10) compared to 10 healthy controls using thrombinography with and
      without thrombomodulin to sensiblise this test at the activated protein C
      pathway. The results of endogenous thrombin potential, the main parameter,
      expressed as a ratio (thrombinography with/without thrombomodulin) were
      significantly higher in cirrhotic patients (0.69 +/- 0.16) than in controls (0.49
      +/- 0.10) which reflects a low sensibility to the action of thrombomodulin. This 
      resistance increases with the severity of the disease assessed by the Child-Pugh 
      score, demonstrating a potential hypercoagulable state. The results of the
      thrombinography challenge the dogma that cirrhotic patients are naturally
      "anticoagulated." These results highlight the potential interest of the
      thrombinography in the detection and monitoring of hypercoagulability in
      cirrhotic patient. Increasing hypercoagulability with the severity of the disease
      seems to be correlated with clinical observations since the occurrence of
      thrombosis is more common when cirrhosis is at an advanced stage.

TI  - Presepsin (sCD14-ST) secretion and kinetics by peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      and monocytic THP-1 cell line.
AB  - Presepsin could help for early diagnosis of systemic infection. Little is known
      regarding its kinetics. We studied presepsin concentration after challenge with
      bacterial agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in peripheral mononuclear 
      cells (PMNC) collected from 5 healthy volunteers and in a human cell line of
      monocytic cells (THP1). In PMNC, an exposure to LPS (100 ng/mL) induced an
      increase of median presepsin levels as early as hour 1 (+31%, p=0.007),
      concomitantly to IL-6 synthesis. In THP1 cells, presepsin was detected at 1 hour 
      after LPS exposure, and peaked at 3 hours, in THP1 cells. In conclusion, we
      report here that presepsin, a surrogate marker of the host response to bacteria, 
      increases early in PMNC and in a monocytic cell lineage. Our findings might
      confirm the potential usefulness of presepsin bedside as an early marker of
      infectious diseases.

TI  - Viral infections of human central nervous system.
AB  - The viruses that can infect the central nervous system of humans are numerous and
      form a heterogeneous group with respect to their structural, functional and
      epidemiological properties. The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to
      associated neurological diseases, mainly meningitis and encephalitis, also are
      complex and often intertwined. Overall, neurological clinical symptoms correspond
      either to acute viral diseases associated with primary infections or to acute,
      subacute or chronic diseases associated with persistent viral infections. The
      frequent severity of the clinical situation requires in all cases the practice of
      virological diagnosis for which the PCR techniques applied to cerebrospinal fluid
      samples occupy a prominent place. The severity of clinical manifestations
      justifies the use of prophylactic vaccination when available and antiviral
      treatment as soon as the causative virus is identified or suspected.

TI  - Direct to consumer genetic testing: is it the moment?
AB  - Since the development of new human genome sequencing technologies at the
      beginning of the 2000, commercial companies have developped direct to consumer
      genomic services, which means without medical prescription. From 2007 to 2013,
      many companies have offered services assesing associated risk with human public
      health in the world especially in the United States. This kind of company is
      forbidden in France. From 2009 to 2013, in United States, under the pressure of
      national or state health administrations, these companies have been progressively
      forbidden. However, in certain parts of the world, companies are still offering
      such services. The latter raise many different questions such as ethical,
      juridical, medical, scientific, educative, professional one. Many studies and
      debates have demonstrated their limit and the lack of usefulness and advantage in
      the field of human health for the time being. The commercialization of this type 
      of services has arrived all too soon et is not yet ripe. In our time of
      globalization, with the lack of international rules controlling direct access to 
      genetic services in the field of human health, there is an urgent need to
      regulate. International administrations and politicians must act fast.
      Inevitably, under the pressure of lobbies and citizens, companies (multinational 
      or not) will develop especially as 1) new sequencing technologies evolve rapidly,
      2) are cheaper from year to year, 3) scientific and medical knowledges are
      progressing quickly, 4) services are spreading faster through the web and other
      networks.

TI  - Negative predictive value of procalcitonin in medullary thyroid carcinoma.
AB  - Calcitonin (CT), the major biochemical marker in medullary thyroid carcinoma
      (MTC) is prone to in vitro instability and suffers from scarcity of clinical
      laboratory platforms. Procalcitonin (PCT), the precursor of CT, free of these
      shortcomings, has been reported as a potential MTC marker. The aim of this study 
      was to assess the negative predictive value (NPV) of PCT as a first-line marker
      in MTC. 476 serum samples referred to our laboratory for CT measurements were
      analyzed for PCT. NPVs of PCT were assessed at 3 cut-offs (0.05, 0.10 and 0.15
      ng/mL) and the diagnosis of MTC was based on CT levels. PCT and CT levels were
      correlated (r=0.7554 for CT levels above 10 pg/mL, n=66). Accepting the CT
      cut-off based on the upper reference limit the NPV of PCT were 98.1% (0.05
      ng/mL), 96.3% (0.10 ng/mL) and 95.4% (0.15 ng/mL) respectively. For a CT cut-off 
      of 100 pg/mL the NPVs of PCT were 100% for all PCT thresholds. Serum PCT has a
      strong NPV and could be a good candidate for a first-line screening test to
      exclude MTC in patients with suspicious thyroid nodules or suggestive symptoms.
      Larger prospective studies are necessary to confirm our results.

TI  - Direct oral anticoagulants: what is the exact assessment of coagulation tests and
      plasma levels by laboratory tests in clinical practice?
AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DAO), anti-IIa or anti-Xa, are intended to be widely 
      used for the treatment and prevention of thrombotic disorders in venous
      thromboembolic disease and atrial fibrillation as an alternative of vitamin K
      antagonists (VKA). Despite predictable pharmacological properties, spontaneous or
      provoked hemorrhagic risks by DAO are major limitations. Thus, after few years of
      inconsistence concerning biological implication and in particular coagulation
      tests, it is now established that we need biology to evaluate hemorrhagic risk
      before surgery or in hemorrhagic cases.

TI  - Optical coherence tomography to evaluate the effects of oxidative hair dye on the
      fiber.
LID - 10.1111/srt.12283 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Oxidative hair dyes can damage the hair, since these chemical
      procedures are involved to change the fiber structure and therefore changes in
      their mechanical and surface properties. Evaluate and compare the effect of the
      two colors of oxidative hair dye emulsions on Caucasian hair. This research
      analyzed the Dark brown hair untreated (I); Dark brown hair treated with light
      brown dye (II); Dark brown hair treated with light blond dye (III); Light blond
      hair untreated (IV); Light blond hair treated with light brown dye (V); Light
      blond hair treated with light blond dye (VI) on Caucasian hair. METHODS: The hair
      samples were submitted to breaking strength, color, and optical coherence
      tomography (OCT) analysis. RESULTS: For the breaking strength assay no presented 
      statistically significant differences between treatments. The parameters of color
      and brightness can differ in some hair dye formulations, but also the hair type
      can respond differently. The OCT images of the sample I and IV was possible
      observed, clearly Medulla and Cortex, which was not observed clearly after
      treatment with both oxidative hair dye colors. CONCLUSION: Based on the results, 
      the oxidative hair dyes increased alteration in color and ultrastructure of hair.

TI  - Rediscussing Anticoagulation in Distal Deep Venous Thrombosis.
LID - 1076029615627343 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Distal deep venous thrombosis (DVT) accounts for approximately half
      of all the cases of lower limb thrombosis. The impact and management of this
      condition is still controversial. This study aims to evaluate the incidence of
      pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with distal DVT in comparison to proximal DVT
      and evaluate the correlation between DVT and PE extension. METHODS: 100 patients 
      with acute lower limb DVT diagnosed with whole leg Doppler ultrasound from
      January 2006 to December 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Active investigation
      for PE was carried out in all patients using multislice computed tomography
      angiography. Classification of DVT and PE was based on the proximal extension of 
      the thrombus. RESULTS: The overall incidence of PE in our sample patients was
      72%. In the subgroup analysis, incidence of PE was equal in both the proximal and
      distal DVT groups (77%, p > 0.99). PE was detected in 43% of the patients with
      isolated calf vein thrombosis (ICVT). No statistical difference was observed
      between the distribution of lobar, segmental and subsegmental PE in the 3 DVT
      subgroups (p = 0.665); however, truncular PE was only observed in the proximal
      DVT group. CONCLUSION: Distal DVT is associated with a high incidence of PE
      compared to proximal DVT. Distal DVT and ICVT can provoke PE with involvement of 
      proximal vessels in the pulmonary arterial tree, even in asymptomatic patients.
      Our study arises discussion in the controversial debate regarding the need for
      routine anticoagulation in distal DVT.

AB  - Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) affects young patients in the most productive
      years of their life, and the consequences of organic or tissue damage involve a
      decrease in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). While acute disease
      manifestations of APS are well known, information on the long-term prognosis and 
      damage in affected patients is still very limited. Systemic lupus erythematosus
      (SLE) patients would be expected to experience long-term complications and even
      die as a consequence of APS. Organ damage in APS has been evaluated using
      different methods and definitions, including the SLICC/ACR Damage Index (SDI),
      which tend to underestimate aPL-related damage. A new damage index in APS has
      been proposed (DIAPS), and it seems to be more accurate than SDI. Given the
      implications for morbidity and mortality, it is imperative to assess accurately
      aPL-related damage and HRQoL in patients with APS.

PG  - 3223-33
LID - 10.1039/c5cp07165h [doi]
AB  - A novel enzymatic platform for the sensing of H2O2 and glucose that uses
      l,l-diphenylalanine micro/nanostructures (FF-MNSs) as an enzyme support is shown.
      This platform is obtained by the self-assembly of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) 
      (PAH), FF-MNSs, and microperoxidase-11 (MP11) anchored onto the peptide matrix,
      in two different crystal structures of FF-MNSs: hexagonal (P61) and orthorhombic 
      (P22121). The electroactive area of the electrodes increases in the presence of
      FF-MNSs. We also demonstrate via theoretical calculations that the valence band
      energy of the orthorhombic structure allows it to be doped, similarly to p-type
      semiconductors, where PAH acts as a doping agent for the orthorhombic peptide
      structure, decreasing the band-gap by around 1 eV, which results in a smaller
      charge transfer resistance. These results are consistent with electrochemical
      impedance spectroscopy measurements, which further elucidate the role of the band
      structure of the orthorhombic FF-MNSs in the conductivity and electron transfer
      rates of the hybrid material. An effective communication between the electrode
      and the active site of a glucose oxidase enzyme through MP11-protein complexes
      occurs, paving the way for FF-MNSs in the orthorhombic phase for the future
      development of bioelectronics sensing devices.

TI  - Geometric and Optic Characterization of a Hemispherical Dome Port for Underwater 
      Photogrammetry.
LID - 10.3390/s16010048 [doi]
LID - E48 [pii]
AB  - The popularity of automatic photogrammetric techniques has promoted many
      experiments in underwater scenarios leading to quite impressive visual results,
      even by non-experts. Despite these achievements, a deep understanding of camera
      and lens behaviors as well as optical phenomena involved in underwater operations
      is fundamental to better plan field campaigns and anticipate the achievable
      results. The paper presents a geometric investigation of a consumer grade
      underwater camera housing, manufactured by NiMAR and equipped with a 7'' dome
      port. After a review of flat and dome ports, the work analyzes, using simulations
      and real experiments, the main optical phenomena involved when operating a camera
      underwater. Specific aspects which deal with photogrammetric acquisitions are
      considered with some tests in laboratory and in a swimming pool. Results and
      considerations are shown and commented.

LID - S1550-4131(15)00525-2 [pii]
AB  - Reductions in calorie intake contribute significantly to the positive outcome of 
      bariatric surgeries. However, the physiological mechanisms linking the rerouting 
      of the gastrointestinal tract to reductions in sugar cravings remain uncertain.
      We show that a duodenal-jejunal bypass (DJB) intervention inhibits maladaptive
      sweet appetite by acting on dopamine-responsive striatal circuitries. DJB
      disrupted the ability of recurrent sugar exposure to promote sweet appetite in
      sated animals, thereby revealing a link between recurrent duodenal sugar influx
      and maladaptive sweet intake. Unlike ingestion of a low-calorie sweetener,
      ingestion of sugar was associated with significant dopamine effluxes in the
      dorsal striatum, with glucose infusions into the duodenum inducing greater
      striatal dopamine release than equivalent jejunal infusions. Consistently,
      optogenetic activation of dopamine-excitable cells of the dorsal striatum was
      sufficient to restore maladaptive sweet appetite in sated DJB mice. Our findings 
      point to a causal link between striatal dopamine signaling and the outcomes of
      bariatric interventions.

TI  - Efficient Condensation of DNA into Environmentally Responsive Polyplexes Produced
      from Block Catiomers Carrying Amine or Diamine Groups.
PG  - 577-86

AB  - The intracellular delivery of nucleic acids requires a vector system as they
      cannot diffuse across lipid membranes. Although polymeric transfecting agents
      have been extensively investigated, none of the proposed gene delivery vehicles
      fulfill all of the requirements needed for an effective therapy, namely, the
      ability to bind and compact DNA into polyplexes, stability in the serum
      environment, endosome-disrupting capacity, efficient intracellular DNA release,
      and low toxicity. The challenges are mainly attributed to conflicting properties 
      such as stability vs efficient DNA release and toxicity vs efficient
      endosome-disrupting capacity. Accordingly, investigations aimed at safe and
      efficient therapies are still essential to achieving gene therapy clinical
      success. Taking into account the mentioned issues, herein we have evaluated the
      DNA condensation ability of poly(ethylene
      oxide)113-b-poly[2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl methacrylate]50 (PEO113-b-PDPA50),
      poly(ethylene oxide)113-b-poly[2-(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate]50
      (PEO113-b-PDEA50), poly[oligo(ethylene glycol)methyl ether
      methacrylate]70-b-poly[oligo(ethylene glycol)methyl ether
      methacrylate10-co-2-(diethylamino)ethyl
      methacrylate47-co-2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl methacrylate47]
      (POEGMA70-b-P(OEGMA10-co-DEA47-co-DPA47), and poly[oligo(ethylene glycol)methyl
      ether methacrylate]70-b-poly{oligo(ethylene glycol)methyl ether
      methacrylate10-co-2-methylacrylic acid
      2-[(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)methylamino]ethyl ester44}
      (POEGMA70-b-P(OEGMA10-co-DAMA44). Block copolymers PEO113-b-PDEA50 and
      POEGMA70-b-P(OEGMA10-co-DEA47-co-DPA47) were evidenced to properly condense DNA
      into particles with a desirable size for cellular uptake via endocytic pathways
      (RH approximately 65-85 nm). The structure of the polyplexes was characterized in
      detail by scattering techniques and atomic force microscopy. The isothermal
      titration calorimetric data revealed that the polymer/DNA binding is endothermic;
      therefore, the process in entropically driven. The combination of results
      supports that POEGMA70-b-P(OEGMA10-co-DEA47-co-DPA47) condenses DNA more
      efficiently and with higher thermodynamic outputs than does PEO113-b-PDEA50.
      Finally, circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated that the conformation of DNA
      remained the same after complexation and that the polyplexes are very stable in
      the serum environment.

AB  - Two effective methods to prepare reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/hematite
      nanostructured photoanodes and their photoelectrochemical characterization
      towards water splitting reactions are presented. First, graphene oxide (GO) is
      reduced to rGO using hydrazine in a basic solution containing tetrabutylammonium 
      hydroxide (TBAOH), and then deposited over the nanostructured hematite
      photoanodes previously treated at 750 degrees C for 30 min. The second method
      follows the deposition of a paste containing a mixture of hematite nanoparticles 
      and rGO sheets by the doctor-blade method, varying the rGO concentration. Since
      hematite suffers from low electron mobility, a low absorption coefficient, high
      recombination rates and slow reaction kinetics, the incorporation of rGO in the
      hematite can overcome such limitations due to graphene's exceptional properties. 
      Using the first method, the rGO incorporation results in a photocurrent density
      increase from 0.56 to 0.82 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 VRHE . Our results indicate that the
      rGO incorporation in the hematite photoanodes shows a positive effect in the
      reduction of the electron-hole recombination rate.

AB  - Adolescents and children are the targets of much food advertising, the majority
      of which is for unhealthy snacks. Although the effects of advertising on food
      preferences and consummatory behavior are well documented, our understanding of
      the underlying mechanisms is still limited. The present study investigates an
      associative (ideomotor) mechanism by which exposure to rewarding (snack) outcomes
      may activate behavior that previously resulted in these rewards. Specifically, we
      used a computerized task to investigate whether exposing adolescents to food
      pictures directly, or to Pavlovian cues predictive of those food pictures, would 
      bias their subsequent responses towards the presented/signaled food. Furthermore,
      we assessed whether this effect was particularly pronounced with palatable,
      high-calorie snacks (crisps and chocolate) relative to low-calorie snacks
      (tomatoes and cucumber). In two experiments, adolescents learnt that certain key 
      presses would yield particular food pictures - some high calorie and others low
      calorie - before learning Pavlovian associations between cues (cartoon monsters) 
      and these same food pictures. Subsequently, in a response-priming test, we
      examined the extent to which the food pictures and Pavlovian cues spontaneously
      primed the previously associated response. The results show that we replicated,
      in adolescents, previous demonstrations of ideomotor response priming in adults: 
      food pictures biased responding towards the response that previously yielded
      them, and this effect transferred to the Pavlovian cues. Furthermore, the priming
      effect was significantly stronger for high-calorie rewards than for low-calorie. 
      These findings indicate that the ideomotor mechanism plays an important role in
      the detrimental effect of our obesogenic environment, with its plethora of
      unhealthy food reminders, on adolescents' food-related choices.

AB  - PURPOSE: The anionic form of the drug mefenamic acid intercalated into the
      nanocarrier layered double hydroxide (LDH-Mef) was evaluated by anti-inflammatory
      and antinociceptive assays. METHODS: The LDH-Mef material was characterized by a 
      set of physicochemical techniques, which was supported by Density Functional
      Theory calculations. The pharmacological effects of LDH-Mef (40 wt% of drug) were
      evaluated by hemolytic, anti-inflammatory activity and antinociceptive assays.
      RESULTS: In vivo assays were conducted for the first time in order to assess the 
      LDH-Mef potential. The hemolytic effects decreased for the intercalated Mef as
      demonstrated by the higher tolerated hemolytic concentration (1.83 mM) compared
      to mefenamic acid (MefH), 0.48 mM. Pretreatment of animals with MefH or LDH-Mef
      reduced carrageenan-, dextran sulfate- and PGE2-induced paw edema. MefH or
      LDH-Mef also decrease total leucocytes and neutrophil counts of the peritoneal
      cavity after inflammation induction with carrageenan. In the nociception model,
      oral pretreatment with LDH-Mef reduced mechanical hypernociception
      carrageenan-induced after 3-4h and also the number of writhings induced by acetic
      acid. CONCLUSIONS: This work shows the increase of the anti-inflammatory and
      antinociceptive potential of the drug confined into the LDH, as well as, its
      hemolytic effect.

PG  - 24-33
LID - 10.1111/pcn.12365 [doi]
AB  - In this narrative review, we explore the history of tobacco smoking, its
      associations and portrayal of its use with luxury and glamour in the past, and
      intriguingly, its subsequent transformation into a mass consumption
      industrialized product encouraged by advertising and film. Then, we describe the 
      next phase where tobacco in parts of the world has become an unwanted product.
      However, the number of smokers is still increasing, especially in new markets,
      and increasingly younger individuals are being attracted to it, despite the
      well-known health consequences of tobacco use. We also explore current smoking
      behaviors, looking at trends in the prevalence of consumption throughout the
      world, discrimination against smokers, light and/or intermittent smokers, and the
      electronic cigarette (e-cigarette). We place these changes in the context of
      neuroscience, which may help explain why the cognitive effects of smoking can be 
      important reinforcers for its consumption despite strong anti-smoking pressure in
      Western countries.

AB  - Neonates that suffer oxygen deprivation during birth can have long lasting
      cognitive deficits, such as memory and learning impairments. Hippocampus, one of 
      the main structures that participate in memory and learning processes, is a
      plastic and dynamic structure that conserves during life span the property of
      generating new cells which can become neurons, the so-called neurogenesis. The
      present study investigated whether a model of rat neonatal anoxia, that causes
      only respiratory distress, is able to alter the hippocampal volume, the
      neurogenesis rate and has functional implications in adult life. MRI analysis
      revealed significant hippocampal volume decrease in adult rats who had
      experienced neonatal anoxia compared to control animals for rostral, caudal and
      total hippocampus. In addition, these animals also had 55.7% decrease of
      double-labelled cells to BrdU and NeuN, reflecting a decrease in neurogenesis
      rate. Finally, behavioral analysis indicated that neonatal anoxia resulted in
      disruption of spatial working memory, similar to human condition, accompanied by 
      an anxiogenic effect. The observed behavioral alterations caused by oxygen
      deprivation at birth might represent an outcome of the decreased hippocampal
      neurogenesis and volume, evidenced by immunohistochemistry and MRI analysis.
      Therefore, based on current findings we propose this model as suitable to explore
      new therapeutic approaches.

TI  - Signaling Mechanisms in the Nitric Oxide Donor- and Amphetamine-Induced Dopamine 
      Release in Mesencephalic Primary Cultured Neurons.

AB  - Previous research has shown that nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitors prevent
      rodents' sensorimotor gating impairments induced by dopamine releasing drugs,
      such as amphetamine (Amph) and methylphenidate. The mechanisms of this effect
      have not been entirely understood. In the present work, we investigated some
      possible mechanisms by which the NO donor, NOC-12
      (3-ethyl-3-(ethylaminoethyl)-1-hydroxy-2-oxo-1-triazene), influence spontaneous
      and Amph-induced dopamine release, using rat mesencephalic primary cultured
      neurons preparations. Our results showed that NOC-12 increased dopamine release
      in a concentration-dependent manner and potentiated the Amph-induced one.
      Dopamine release induced by NOC-12 was disrupted by N-acetyl-L-cystein (NAC-a
      free radical scavenger) and MK-801, a NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) non-competitive
      antagonist, and was concentration dependently affected by
      oxadiazolo[4,3]quinoxalin-1-one, an inhibitor of the soluble guanylate cyclase
      (sGC). In contrast, dopamine released by Amph was facilitated by NAC and by
      MK-801 and not affected by nifedipine (a L-type-Ca(+2) channel blocker), which
      enhanced NOC-12-induced dopamine release. The present work demonstrates that DA
      release induced by NOC-12 is partially dependent on sGC and on NMDA activation,
      and is modulated by L-type Ca(+2) channel and the antioxidant NAC. This mechanism
      differs from the Amph-induced one, which appears not to depend on L-type Ca(+2)
      channel and seems to be facilitated by NMDA channel blocking and by NAC. These
      results suggest that Amph and NOC-12 induce dopamine release through
      complementary pathways, which may explain the potentiation of Amph-induced
      dopamine release by NOC-12. These findings contribute to understand the
      involvement of NO in dopamine-related neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative
      diseases.

AB  - Hypervalent organotellurium compounds (organotelluranes) have shown several
      promising applications, including their use as potent and selective cysteine
      protease inhibitors and antiprotozoal agents. Here, we report the antimalarial
      activities of three organotellurane derivatives (RF05, RF07 and RF19) in two
      Plasmodium falciparum strains (CQS 3D7 and CQR W2), which demonstrated
      significant decreases in parasitemia in vitro. The inhibition of intracellular P.
      falciparum proteases by RF05, RF07 and RF19 was determined and the IC50 values
      were 3.7+/-1.0muM, 1.1+/-0.2muM and 0.2+/-0.01muM, respectively. Using an assay
      performed in the presence of the ER Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor we showed that the
      main enzymatic targets were cysteine proteases stimulated by calcium (calpains). 
      None of the compounds tested caused haemolysis or a significant decrease in
      endothelial cell viability in the concentration range used for the inhibition
      assay. Taken together, the results suggest promising compounds for the
      development of antimalarial drugs.

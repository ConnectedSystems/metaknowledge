<p>metaknowledge is a <a href="https://www.python.org">Python3</a> library that simplifies bibliometric and computational sociology of knowledge research using Web of Science data. It reads a directory of plain text files containing meta-data on publications and citations, and writes to a variety of data structures that are suitable for quantitative, network, and text analyses. It handles large datasets (e.g. several million records) efficiently, and currently has functions for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cleaning and preprocessing Web of Science data (e.g. identifying and deleting duplicate records)</li>
  <li>extracting co-author, citation, and co-citation networks for published papers, authors, and journals</li>
  <li>extracting multi-mode networks using any of the meta-data fields available in the Web of Science database (e.g. papers and keywords)</li>
  <li>extracting data for textual analysis (e.g. titles, abstracts)</li>
</ul>

<p>Datasets created with <a href="https://github.com/networks-lab/metaknowledge">metaknowledge</a> can be analyzed using the standard libraries for data analysis in Python, including <a href="https://networkx.github.io"> NetworkX</a>. It is also easy to write data to csv or graphml files for analysis and visualization in <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a>, <a href="http://visone.info">Visone</a>, <a href="http://gephi.github.io">Gephi</a>, or any other tools for data analysis.</p>

<p>metaknowledge also has a simple command line tool for extracting quantitative datasets and network files from Web of Science files. This makes the library more accessible to researchers who do not know Python, and makes it easier to quickly explore new datasets.</p>
